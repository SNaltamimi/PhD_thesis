abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to provide an overview of theories used in the field of employees' information systems (IS) security behavior over the past decade. Research gaps and implications for future research are worked out by analyzing and synthesizing existing literature. Design/methodology/approach – This paper presents the results of a literature review comprising 113 publications. The literature review was designed to identify applied theories and to understand the cognitive determinants in the research field. A meta-model that explains employees' IS security behavior is introduced by assembling the core constructs of the used theories. Findings – The paper identified 54 used theories, but four behavioral theories were primarily used: Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), General Deterrence Theory (GDT), Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). By synthesizing results of empirically tested research models, a survey of factors proven to have a significant influence on employees' security behavior is presented. Research limitations/implications – Some relevant publications might be missing within this literature review due to the selection of search terms and/or databases. However, by conduction a forward and a backward search, this paper has limited this error source to a minimum. Practical implications – This study presents an overview of determinants that have been proven to influence employees' behavioral intention. Based thereon, concrete training and awareness measures can be developed. This is valuable for practitioners in the process of designing Security Education, Training and Awareness (SETA) programs. Originality/value – This paper presents a comprehensive up-to-date overview of existing academic literature in the field of employees' security awareness and behavior research. Based on a developed meta-model, research gaps are identified and implications for future research are worked out. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Knowledge-intensive organizations are characterized by their dependency
on highly skilled personnel who perform their daily work in a
decentralized manner. In these organizations it is the users who make
the important decisions, and therefore the organization's information
security awareness is upheld by and depends on its users' combined
security awareness. To assess the overall organizational security
awareness it therefore becomes interesting to assess both the users'
individual level of security awareness, as well as their level of
consistency and conformity with regard to other users' awareness.
In the present case study, 15 semi-structured interviews have been
undertaken within a large telecommunication company in order to
understand how significant IT security aspects are understood within the
organization. The study highlights a number of perception differences
where the technical IT staff and the ordinary users do not share the
same understanding. It is suggested that these perception differences
result from a paradoxical situation where the users' possibility to
uphold security awareness is hindered because of security concerns.},

abstract = {Auditing has always played an important role in the business environment. With the introduction of information technology and the resulting security challenges that organizations face daily, it has become essential to ensure the security of the organization's information and other valuable assets. However, one aspect that auditing does not cover effectively is that of the behaviour of the employee, which is so crucial to any organization's security. The objective of this paper is to explore the potential problems concerning the attempt to audit the behaviour of the employee. It will be demonstrated that it is extremely difficult to audit human behaviour and so an alternative method to behavioural auditing needs to be found, where policing the employee is not necessary, but instead a softer, more informal approach is used to change the culture to a more information security conscious one. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper identifies the need for security awareness and describes the prototype implementation of a software tool that enables individuals to pursue self-paced security training. The tool provides an environment that permits the user to simulate the introduction of security into a number of pre-defined case study scenarios. This enables staff to become familiar with the types of countermeasures available, the situations in which they are appropriate and any constraints that they may impose. This would be particularly valuable in small organisations where specialist knowledge is often scarce and issues need to be addressed by existing staff.},

Security techniques and management tools have caught a lot of attention from both academia and practitioners. However, there is lacking a theoretical framework for information security management.

This paper suggests that an integrated system theory is useful for understanding information security management, explaining information security management strategies, and predicting management outcomes. This theory may lay a solid theoretical foundation for further empirical research and application.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {The literature agrees that the major threat to IS security is constituted by careless employees who do not comply with organizations' IS security policies and procedures. To address this concern , different approaches for ensuring employees' IS security policy compliance have been proposed. Prior research on IS security compliance has criticized these extant IS security awareness approaches as lacking theoretically and empirically grounded principles to ensure that employees comply with IS security policies. To fill this gap, this study proposes a theoretical model that contains the factors that explain employees' IS security policy compliance. Data (N=245) from a Finnish company provides empirical support for the model. The results suggest tha t information quality has a significant effect on actual IS security policy compliance. Employees' attitude, normative beliefs and habits have significant effect on intention to comply with IS security policy. Threat appraisa l a nd facilitating conditions have significant impact on attitude towards complying, while coping appraisal does not have a significant effect on employees' attitude towards complying. Sanctions have insignificant effect on intention to comply with IS security policy a nd rewards do not have a significant effect on actual compliance with IS security policy.},

Study's subjects (N=24) were recruited from three UK Government organizations to attend a semi structured interview. Transcribed texts were analyzed using the approach termed interpretive phenomenological analysis. Results showed that the most important factors influencing risk acceptance of cloud services are: perceived benefits and opportunities, organization's risk culture and perceived risks.

In this work we present a general formal framework to perform analysis for malicious insider threats, based on probabilistic modelling, verification, and synthesis techniques. The framework first identifies insiders' intention to perform an inside attack, using Bayesian networks, and in a second phase computes the probability of success for an inside attack by this actor, using probabilistic model checking.},

abstract = {The application of information security technologies do not always result in improved security. Human factors play a significant role in computer security; factors such as individual difference, cognitive abilities and personality traits can impact on behaviour. Information security behaviours are also greatly influenced by an individuals perception of risk. All of these factors are also affected by the organisation culture and security environment in which they occur. These factors interact with one another and can result in behaviours that are often detrimental to information security. This report provides recommendations as to how these human and cultural factors can be influenced to result in more positive behaviours and lead to more secure information environments.},

abstract = {Abstract The main purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between individuals' Information Security Awareness (ISA) and individual difference variables, namely age, gender, personality and risk-taking propensity. Within this study, {\{}ISA{\}} was defined as individuals' knowledge of what policies and procedures they should follow, their understanding of why they should adhere to them (their attitude) and what they actually do (their behaviour). This was measured using the Human Aspects of Information Security Questionnaire (HAIS-Q). Individual difference variables were examined via a survey of 505 working Australians. It was found that conscientiousness, agreeableness, emotional stability and risk-taking propensity significantly explained variance in individuals' ISA, while age and gender did not. Knowledge of, and attitude towards information security (InfoSec) policies and procedures, explained the most variance in self-reported InfoSec behaviour. Findings highlighted the need for future research to examine individual differences and their impact on ISA. Results of the study can be applied by industry to develop tailored InfoSec training programs. },

Open coding analysis was performed on numerous publications (articles, surveys, standards, reports and books). A classification scheme of six categories of concern has emerged from the content analysis (e.g., terminology ambiguity), and the chosen publications were classified based on it. The paper identifies ambiguous aspects of current security awareness approaches and the proposed classification provides a guide to identify the range of options available to researchers and practitioners when they design their research and practice on information security awareness.

This glossary includes most of the terms in the NIST publications. It also contains nearly all of the terms and definitions from CNSSI-4009. This glossary provides a central resource of terms and definitions most commonly used in NIST information security publications and in CNSS information assurance publications. For a given term, we do not include all definitions in NIST documents ? especially not from the older NIST publications. Since draft documents are not stable, we do not refer to terms/definitions in them. Each entry in the glossary points to one or more source NIST publications, and/or CNSSI-4009, and/or supplemental sources where appropriate.

It promises simplified and flexible user management, reduced administrative costs, improved security, as well as the integration of employees' business functions into the IT administration. A comprehensive scientific literature collection revealed more than 1300 publications dealing with the application of sociological role theory in the context of Information Security up to now. Although there is an ANSI/NIST standard and an ISO standard proposal, a variety of competing models and interpretations of the role concept have developed. The major contribution of this survey is a categorization of the complete underlying set of publications into different classes. The main part of the work is investigating 32 identified research directions, evaluating their importance and analyzing research tendencies. An electronic bibliography including all surveyed publications together with the classification information is provided additionally.

abstract = {Security threats caused by the inappropriate actions of the user continue to be a significant security problem within any organization. The purpose of this study was to continue the efforts of Katz by assessing the security behavior and practices of working professionals. Katz conducted a study that assessed whether the faculty and staff at Armstrong Atlantic State University had been performing the simple everyday practices and behavior necessary to avert insider threats to information security. Critical in understanding human behavior is in knowing how behavior varies across different groups or demographics. Because a user's behavior can be influenced by demographic groups, this study adapted Katz's study by examining the influence on the security behavior of four demographic groups identified by gender, age, education, and occupation. Like Katz, this study used a 5-point Likert scale quantitative self-administered, closed-ended questionnaire to assess the participants' security practices and behaviors. The questionnaire was developed in two sections: Section 1 used a binary scale to gather the participants' demographics data while Section 2 used a 5-point Likert scale to measure the participants' security behaviors. The sample population was derived from working professionals at the General Dynamic and Program Manager Advanced Amphibious Assault (GD {\&} PM AAA) Facility in Woodbridge, Virginia. The total population at PM AAA Office was 288, of which 87 or 30{\%} completed the survey. Results of the demographic survey indicate that (a) women were more security aware than their male counterparts, (b) younger participants were more security aware than their older counterparts, (c) participants who did not attend college were more security aware than their college-educated counterparts, and (d) participants in nontechnical positions were more security aware than their counterparts in technical positions. The results indicate that a relation exists between the participants' security behaviors and their levels of security awareness.},

The programme emphasised employee participation, dialogue and collective reflection in groups. The intervention consisted of small-sized workshops aimed at improving information security awareness and behaviour. An experimental research design consisting of one survey before and two after the intervention was used to evaluate whether the intended changes occurred. Statistical analyses revealed that the intervention was powerful enough to significantly change a broad range of awareness and behaviour indicators among the intervention participants. In the control group, awareness and behaviour remained by and large unchanged during the period of the study. Unlike the approach taken by the intervention studied in this paper, mainstream information security awareness measures are typically top-down, and seek to bring about changes at the individual level by means of an expert-based approach directed at a large population, e.g. through formal presentations, e-mail messages, leaflets and posters. This study demon-strates that local employee participation, collective reflection and group processes produce changes in short-term information security awareness and behaviour.},

Within this study, {\{}ISA{\}} was defined as individuals' knowledge of what policies and procedures they should follow, their understanding of why they should adhere to them (their attitude) and what they actually do (their behaviour). This was measured using the Human Aspects of Information Security Questionnaire (HAIS-Q). Individual difference variables were examined via a survey of 505 working Australians. It was found that conscientiousness, agreeableness, emotional stability and risk-taking propensity significantly explained variance in individuals' ISA, while age and gender did not. Knowledge of, and attitude towards information security (InfoSec) policies and procedures, explained the most variance in self-reported InfoSec behaviour. Findings highlighted the need for future research to examine individual differences and their impact on ISA. Results of the study can be applied by industry to develop tailored InfoSec training programs. },

Having given privileged access to sensitive and valuable patient information in the EMR, healthcare employees may cause privacy breaches, which may lead to detrimental consequences. Therefore, it is paramount to impose particular attention to healthcare employees' concerns on privacy in the use of EMR. The aim of this study is to identify the factors that influence information privacy concerns (IPC) in the use of EMR from healthcare employees' perspective. Systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify articles pertinent to IPC. EBSCOhost, IEEE Explore, SAGE, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Wiley Online Library and Taylor {\&} Francis Online database were searched for reviews relevance articles. A total of 38 full articles were reviewed to extract the factors that influence the IPC. From the review, it revealed three influential factors, namely privacy risk, privacy awareness, and privacy policy. Furthermore, preliminary qualitative study has been done in this study helps in understanding the privacy practices, to validate the identified factors and relationships with IPC. This study may be of significance in providing useful information for healthcare organisations to understand IPC from their employees' perspective in ensuring the compliance towards privacy regulations.},

This study first analyzes relevant researches on the intention to use such systems as the basis for the questionnaire design, then conducts questionnaire survey among district hospital nurses, head directors, and other related personnel. After the questionnaires are collected, SEM is used to analyze the data. The analysis shows that the proposed factors positively influence users' intention to use a healthcare system.

In the proposed framework, pri-vacy protection, access control, and secure transmission mod-ules are designed to enhance the privacy protection of a HIS. An experimental privacy-enhanced HIS is also implemented. Furthermore, we proposed a research model extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology by consid-ering perceived security and information security literacy and then investigate user adoption of a privacy-enhanced HIS. The experimental results and analyses showed that user adoption of a privacy-enhanced HIS is directly affected by social influence, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and perceived security. Perceived security has a mediating effect between information security literacy and user adoption.

@article{Buyya2009,
abstract = {With the significant advances in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) over the last half century, there is an increasingly perceived vision that computing will one day be the 5th utility (after water, electricity, gas, and telephony). This computing utility, like all other four existing utilities, will provide the basic level of computing service that is considered essential to meet the everyday needs of the general community. To deliver this vision, a number of computing paradigms have been proposed, of which the latest one is known as Cloud computing. Hence, in this paper, we define Cloud computing and provide the architecture for creating Clouds with market-oriented resource allocation by leveraging technologies such as Virtual Machines (VMs). We also provide insights on market-based resource management strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management and computational risk management to sustain Service Level Agreement (SLA)-oriented resource allocation. In addition, we reveal our early thoughts on interconnecting Clouds for dynamically creating global Cloud exchanges and markets. Then, we present some representative Cloud platforms, especially those developed in industries, along with our current work towards realizing market-oriented resource allocation of Clouds as realized in Aneka enterprise Cloud technology. Furthermore, we highlight the difference between High Performance Computing (HPC) workload and Internet-based services workload. We also describe a meta-negotiation infrastructure to establish global Cloud exchanges and markets, and illustrate a case study of harnessing 'Storage Clouds' for high performance content delivery. Finally, we conclude with the need for convergence of competing IT paradigms to deliver our 21st century vision.},

abstract = {— Cloud computing has emerged as one of the most discussed topics among enterprise IT professionals. This paper is giving list of cloud computing advantages and disadvantages and some reasons will cause company adopt cloud based services or avoiding. The small and medium size enterprise does not possess sufficient financial and human recourse, in comparison to the large size factories, hence they are not capable of upgrading their IT requirements efficiently, It will not allow them to have a sufficient chance to compete with powerful competitors, in a business environment. Evaluating the impact of organizational factors on cloud computing adoption in SMEs was determined as the main purpose of this study and led to focus on the TOE framework as a famous theory on evaluating IT adoption. For this purpose, organizational context divided into three main factors in base of TOE framework include organizational, environmental and technical context. Three set of critical success factor criteria chosen by review of previous studies for each three level of organizational factors. It can be helpful for small and medium size enterprises which want to evaluate their organizational condition for adopting cloud based services. Keywords},

As a result, this study focuses on the adoption of cloud computing among Vietnamese companies. Eight factors were identified as determinants of cloud computing adoption by combining the two widely applied IT theories i.e. Diffusion on Innovation and Technology-Organization-Environment framework. In the future with eight factors we will conduct survey, factor analysis and logistic regression to determine factors affecting cloud computing adoption. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Previously the traditional healthcare information system that used in the healthcare sector was the paper-based and then later it was replaced by the Healthcare Information System (HIS). However the HIS was found not perform effectively because of several issues such as storage capacity, system integration, high operating cost and system maintenance. Cloud computing is a new technology that deliver the software, infrastructure and computational platform as a service over the Internet in any place and any time. This technology has been said can solve many problems of the healthcare system such as increase the storage capacity and add new capability on the existing healthcare system. Cloud computing offers cost effective, increase interoperability and accessibility, optimize resources and integrate the healthcare information systems. It becomes a solution for solving the current issues, which lead to enhance functionality and features of the healthcare information systems. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the cloud computing technology as solution for healthcare information system issues. Issues such as data transmission, data storage, cost and maintenance issues are presented and described. The implications of this study then discussed.},

@article{Kierkegaard2011,
abstract = {a b s t r a c t The European Commission wants to boost the digital economy by enabling all Europeans to have access to online medical records anywhere in Europe by 2020. With the newly enacted Directive 2011/24/EU on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare due for implementation by 2013, it is inevitable that a centralised European health record system will become a reality even before 2020. However, the concept of a centralised supranational central server raises concern about storing electronic medical records in a central location. The privacy threat posed by a supranational network is a key concern. Cross-border and Interoperable electronic health record systems make confidential data more easily and rapidly accessible to a wider audience and increase the risk that personal data concerning health could be accidentally exposed or easily distributed to unauthorised parties by enabling greater access to a compilation of the personal data concerning health, from different sources, and throughout a lifetime.},

abstract = {Public health research and practice often have been facilitated through the evaluation and study of population-based data collected by local, state, and federal governments. However, recent concerns about identify theft, confidentiality, and patient privacy have led to increasingly restrictive policies on data access, often preventing researchers from using these valuable data. We believe that these restrictions, and the research impeded or precluded by their implementation and enforcement, have had a significant negative impact on important public health research. Members of the public health community should challenge these policies through their professional societies and by lobbying legislators and health officials to advocate for changes that establish a more appropriate balance between privacy concerns and the protection of public health.},
