Hagen and Albrechtsen (2009) conducted an intervention study to measure the effectiveness of Individual Security  Awareness (ISA) training program using "e-learning software" in a maritime industry. This E-learning tool aims to enhance the employee's overall information security knowledge, awareness and behaviour through six training models each of which covers a security aspect. This study used two survey questionnaires, the first one was distributed a week before the ISA tool was launched, and the second survey was disseminated three weeks after the ISA training program was finished. The results reveal that the ISA e-learning program has improved the overall- short-term information security knowledge, awareness and behaviour of the employees in the intervention group. The employees who were finished the training program showed a significant awareness enhancement related to security concerns. For instance, the ISA participants showed more tendency to report frequent security incident violations, secure their unattended personal computer, and protect their password. These results identify that the improvement of security awareness has a positive effect on the employee's security behaviour.
