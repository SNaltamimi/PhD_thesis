abstract = {In organizations, users' compliance with information security policies (ISP) is crucial for minimizing information security (IS) incidents. To improve users' compliance, IS managers have implemented IS awareness (ISA) programs, which are systematically planned interventions to continuously transport security information to a target audience. The underlying research analyzes IS managers' efforts to design effective ISA programs by comparing current design recommendations suggested by scientific literature with actual design practices of ISA programs in three banks. Moreover, this study addresses how users perceive ISA programs and related implications for compliant IS behavior. Empirically, we utilize a multiple case design to investigate three banks from Central and Eastern Europe. In total, 33 semi-structured interviews with IS managers and users were conducted and internal materials of ISA programs such as intranet messages and posters were also considered. The paper contributes to IS compliance research by offering a comparative and holistic view on ISA program design practices. Moreover, we identified influences on users' perceptions centering on IS risks, responsibilities, ISP importance and knowledge, and neutralization behaviors. Finally, the study raises propositions regarding the relationship of ISA program designs and factors, which are likely to influence users' ISP compliance.},

This paper attempts to integrate etiological research on white-collar crime under the hypothesis that criminal behavior results from the confluence of appropriate motivation and opportunity. The starting point is the interactionist theory of motivation basic to most of the social psychological research on white-collar crime. Interactionist theory helps us understand white-collar crime in terms of the of-fenders' symbolic construction of their social worlds but ultimately fails to explain its causes. It is argued that the origins of symbolic motivational patterns are to be found in the social structure of industrial capitalism and the "culture of competition" to which it gives rise. But no theory of motivation, however sophisticated, is sufficient to explain the causes of white-collar crime, and the paper therefore concludes with an analysis of the patterns of opportunities presented to social actors in different structural positions in ad-vanced capitalist nations. Since Edwin Sutherland first introduced the concept of white-collar crime},

The present research attempts to evaluate neutralization theory for predicting variation in self-reported expected illegal behavior in a random sample of 350 adults. Data analysis indicates that (1) neutralization is conceptually and empirically distinct from moral commitment, and (2) the interaction between moral commitment and neutrali-zation significantly explains expected involvement in future deviance.},

Results show that perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, and self-efficacy are determinants of email related security behavior.

Specifically, we investigate the rationality basedfactors that drive an employee to comply with require ments of the ISP with regard to protecting the organization's information and technology resources. Drawing on the theory of planned behavior, we posit that, along with norma tive belief and self-efficacy, an employee's attitude toward compliance determines intention to comply with the ISP. As a key contribution, we posit that an employee's attitude is influenced by benefit of compliance, cost of compliance, and cost of noncompliance, which are beliefs about the overall assessment of consequences of compliance or noncom pliance. We then postulate that these beliefs are shaped by the employee's outcome beliefs concerning the events that follow compliance or noncompliance: benefit of compliance is shaped by intrinsic benefit, safety of resources, and rewards, while cost of compliance is shaped by work impedi ment; and cost of noncompliance is shaped by intrinsic cost, vulnerability of resources, and sanctions. We also investi gate the impact of information security awareness (ISA) on outcome beliefs and an employee's attitude toward com pliance with the ISP. Our results show that an employee's intention to comply with the ISP is significantly influenced by attitude, normative beliefs, and self-efficacy to comply.

abstract = {Self-determination theory (SDT) is an empirically based theory of human motivation, development, and wellness. The theory focuses on types, rather than just amount, of motivation, paying particular attention to autonomous motivation, controlled motivation, and amotivation as predictors of performance, rela-tional, and well-being outcomes. It also addresses the social conditions that enhance versus diminish these types of motivation, proposing and finding that the degrees to which basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are supported versus thwarted affect both the type and strength of motivation. SDT also examines people's life goals or aspirations, showing differential relations of intrinsic versus extrinsic life goals to performance and psychological health. In this introduction we also briefly discuss recent developments within SDT concerning mindfulness and vitality, and highlight the applicability of SDT within applied domains, including work, relationships, parenting, education, virtual environments, sport, sustainability, health care, and psychotherapy. As a macrotheory of human motivation, self-determination theory (SDT) addresses such basic issues as personality devel-opment, self-regulation, universal psychological needs, life goals and aspirations, energy and vitality, nonconscious pro-cesses, the relations of culture to motivation, and the impact of social environments on motivation, affect, behavior, and well-being. Further, the theory has been applied to issues within a wide range of life domains. Although the initial work leading to SDT dates back to the 1970s and the first relatively comprehensive statement of SDT appeared in the mid-1980s (Deci {\&} Ryan, 1985), it has been during the past decade that research on SDT has truly mushroomed. Basic research expanding and refining motivational principles has con-tinued at a vigorous pace, but the huge increase in the volume of published SDT studies has been most apparent in the applied fields—in sport, education, and health care, for example. Indeed, the diversity of topics covered in the papers of this special issue, along with the amount of research cited in each paper, make clear how extensive the literature has become. Earlier this year we published an article in Canadian Psychol-ogy presenting an overview of SDT (Deci {\&} Ryan, 2008). Here we present a much briefer introduction to the theory that will provide a structure to help focus readers as they begin the series of papers. It is particularly appropriate that this special issue appears in Canadian Psychology insofar as a substantial portion of the con-tributions to SDT has been accomplished by Canadian scholars, beginning with the work of Vallerand (e.g., Vallerand, 1983). Since then SDT has been extended and applied by scholars across Canada, to which the papers in the current volume clearly attest.},

abstract = {Consumer privacy concerns with respect to mobile advertis-ing have become an important issue for policymakers, trade groups, and consumer advocates as unfair information practices continue to escalate in many countries. In the United States, unsolicited messages or spam increased by 38{\%} from 2006 to 2007 and was expected to increase by 50{\%} more to 1.5 million messages in 2008 (Cloudmark 2008). Some spam messages request mobile users to provide personal information, includ-ing their credit card numbers, or attempt to infi ltrate mobile devices with virus programs by asking users to register for services (CNET.co.uk 2006). To alleviate consumers' concerns about these potential invasions, the mobile industry has implemented several self-regulations. For example, the Mobile Marketing Association recently revised its consumer best practices guidelines, includ-ing those regarding promotional content and marketing to children; it also expanded and clarifi ed its guidelines for free, standard, and premium rate messaging, mobile Web, and interactive voice responses (Mobile Marketing Association 2008). The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) held a town hall meeting in May 2008 for business executives, consumer advocates, and scholars to explore issues of mobile privacy and consumer protection (Corbin 2008). In Japan, spam regulation violators may be sentenced to up to one year in prison and a fi ne of up to 1 million yen (approximately US{\$}11,135) (Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications 2008). Despite these different regulatory measures, what makes the most effective type of regulation in terms of protecting consumer information privacy remains a topic of debate. To assess the appropriateness of different approaches, we might examine mobile users' preferences for the degree of regulatory control, because users infl uence both mobile service providers and regulatory government agencies. Therefore, this research explores the relationship between consumer privacy concerns in mobile advertising and their preference for three types of regulations: government regulation, industry self-regulation, and government and industry coregulation. Government regulation constitutes an authoritative and powerful exertion of government control (Rose 2006). With self-regulation, an industry-level organization sets and reinforces rules and standards relating to the conduct of fi rms and individuals in the industry, whereas coregulation refers to mixed systems that involve some type of government regulation of the self-regulation (Gupta and Lad 1983). Furthermore, we employ social contract theory as an over-arching framework that connects the key study variables, including trust, perceived risk, and perceived ubiquity. Mobile},

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is one of many organizations studying influences on consumer privacy online. The authors investigate these influences, taking into consideration the current body of literature on privacy and the Internet and the FTC's core principles of fair information practice. The authors analyze these influences to assess the underlying fac-tors of privacy concern online. The authors examine the current recommendations and actions of the FTC in light of the results of an e-mail survey of online consumers in the United States that assessed their attitudes toward privacy online. The authors find that the FTC's core principles address many of online consumers' privacy concerns. However, two factors not directly incorporated in the five principles, the relationships between entities and online users and the exchange of information for appropriate compensation, may influ-ence consumers' privacy concerns. As worldwide sales of Internet-related products and services by U.S. companies reached an estimated {\$}301 billion in 1998 (Barua et al. 1999), marketers and policymakers are investigating optimal ways to use and regulate this new medium. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been evaluating the online marketplace since its inception (FTC 1998) and has identified privacy as a key issue that Internet marketers need to recognize and address. Consumer privacy in general has been identified as a "sig-nificant marketing issue of the 90's" (Jones 1991, p. 133). The importance of online consumer privacy was reinforced in the U.S. Department of Commerce's (1998) report The Emerging Digital Economy, which stated that the Internet's potential challenges marketers to overcome a variety of con-cerns, primarily in respect to credit card security and con-sumer privacy.

abstract = {Recent academic investigations of computer security policy violations have largely focused on non-malicious noncompliance due to poor training, low employee motivation, weak affective commitment, or individual oversight. Established theoretical foundations applied to this domain have related to protection motivation, deterrence, planned behavior, self-efficacy, individual adoption factors, organizational commitment, and other individual cognitive factors. But another class of violation demands greater research emphasis: the intentional commission of computer security policy violation, or insider computer abuse. Whether motivated by greed, disgruntlement, or other psychological processes, this act has the greatest potential for loss and damage to the employer. We argue the focus must include not only the act and its immediate antecedents of intention (to commit computer abuse) and deterrence (of the crime), but also phenomena which temporally precede these areas. Specifically, we assert the need to consider the thought processes of the potential offender and how these are influenced by the organizational context, prior to deterrence. We believe the interplay between thought processes and this context may significantly impact the efficacy of IS security controls, specifically deterrence safeguards. Through this focus, we extend the Straub and Welke (1998) security action cycle framework and propose three areas worthy of empirical investigation—techniques of neutralization (rationalization), expressive/instrumental criminal motivations, and disgruntlement as a result of perceptions of organizational injustice—and propose questions for future research in these areas.},

In the organizations whose non-work-related Website access in the workplace is prohibited as a rule, heightening the degree of OC is able to reduce the respondents who access non-work-related Websites in their workplace.

abstract = {1. Introduction Information security incidents have increased significantly in the last decade. In order to cope with increased threats, not only technical solutions, but IS security policies have been proposed. Employees, however, seldom comply with these policies, placing their organizations' assets and businesses at risk. In order to address this concern, several information security policies compliance approaches have been proposed. We have decided to build a new multi-theory based model using the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), and the Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET) and then to validate it empirically using a large sample of practitioners from Finland (N = 669). 2. Previous work on information security policy compliance Recent research studies on the topic of security policy compliance have been divided into three categories: (1) conceptual principles with no underlying theory or empirical evidence; (2) theoretical models with no empirical evidence; and (3) empirical work grounded in theory. Employees' compliance of information systems security policies Multi-theory based model to explain employees' adherence to information security policies SEM-based analysis of the model A B S T R A C T The key threat to information security comes from employees who do not comply with information security policies. We developed a new multi-theory based model that explained employees' adherence to security policies. The paradigm combines elements from the Protection Motivation Theory, the Theory of Reasoned Action, and the Cognitive Evaluation Theory. We validated the model by using a sample of 669 responses from four corporations in Finland. The SEM-based results showed that perceived severity of potential information security threats, employees' belief as to whether they can apply and adhere to information security policies, perceived vulnerability to potential security threats, employees' attitude toward complying with information security policies, and social norms toward complying with these policies had a significant and positive effect on the employees' intention to comply with information security policies. Intention to comply with information security policies also had a significant impact on actual compliance with these policies. High level managers must warn employees of the importance of information security and why it is necessary to carry out these policies. In addition, employees should be provided with security education and hands on training.},

This research investigated (1) the attitudes of patients toward sharing their medical information and (2) whether patients con-sidered themselves to be well-informed about the uses that are made of their information. Methods: A questionnaire survey of adult primary-care patients was conducted in five clinics within a medium sized New Zealand city. Outcome measures were the proportions of respondents willing to share different categories of their information with different classes of recipients. Patients' evaluations of their knowledge about the uses made of their information were also collected. Results: Over 200 responses were collected from five clinics. Respondents' attitudes toward sharing their information were found to be influenced by three factors. (1) Identity of recipient: whilst respondents were generally willing to have their infor-mation shared between health professionals, they were increasingly unwilling for it to be distributed to other stakeholders, such as administrators, researchers or other government departments. (2) Level of anonymity: respondents were more prepared to share anonymous information. (3) Type of information: respondents were increasingly unwilling to share their information as it takes on a more personal nature. Respondents were also found to be very poorly informed about the use of their information, 90{\%} of respondents indicated that they had either incomplete or no knowledge of how their information was shared and 79{\%} had no knowledge of the uses of their National Health Index (NHI) number.

Further, where the organisational culture revolves around trust, as in the medical environment, insider threats, both malicious and non-malicious, are difficult to manage. International research has shown that changing security culture and increasing awareness is necessary as technical resolutions are not sufficient to control insider threats. This area of information security is both important and topical in view of the recently publicised breaches of patient health information. Ensuring that all staff assumes responsibility for information security, particularly as part of an information security governance framework, is one practical solution to the problem of insider threats.},

Abstract Employee noncompliance with information systems security policies is a key concern for organizations. If users do not comply with IS security policies, security solutions lose their efficacy. Of the different IS security policy compliance ap proaches, training is the most commonly suggested in the literature.

Consequently, there is a need for IS security training approaches that are theory-based and empirically evaluated. Accordingly, we propose a training program based on two theories: the universal constructive instruc tional theory and the elaboration likelihood model. We then validate the training program for IS security policy com pliance training through an action research project. The action research intervention suggests that the theory-based training achievedpositive results and was practical to deploy. Moreover, the intervention suggests that information security training should utilize contents and methods that activate and motivate the learners to systematic cognitive processing of information they receive during the training. In addition, the action research study made clear that a continuous communi cation process was also required to improve user IS security policy compliance. The findings of this study offer new insights for scholars and practitioners involved in IS security policy compliance.},

A major challenge for organizations is encouraging employee compliance with security policies, procedures and guidelines. Specifically, we predict that security culture, job satisfaction and perceived organizational support have a positive effect on employees' security compliance intentions. Design/methodology/approach – This study used a survey approach for data collection. Data were collected using two online surveys that were administered at separate points in time. Findings – Our results provide empirical support for security culture as a driver of employees' security compliance in the workplace. Another finding is that an employee's feeling of job satisfaction influences his/her security compliance intention, although this relationship appears to be contingent on the employee's position, tenure and industry.

abstract = {Neutralization theory, though a popular framework for understanding deviant behavior, remains badly underdeveloped. Few attempts have been made to connect it to narrative and sociocognitive research in psychology and related fields. From this wider perspective, one reason neutralization theory has received only mixed empirical support is that it has been understood as a theory of criminal etiology. This makes little sense (how can one neutralize something before they have done it?) and makes the theory difficult to test. Neutralization should instead be seen as playing a role in persistence in or desistance from criminal behavior. The theory's central premises need to be substantially complicated. The notions that all excuses or justifications are "bad" and that reform involves "accepting complete responsibility" for one's actions are not tenable. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Previous research indicates that neutralization - a form of rationalization - can help to explain software piracy intentions. However, a knowledge gap exists in our understanding about which techniques of neutralization contributes most to software piracy intentions. To address this gap, we advance a model that explains the effects of neutralization techniques on software piracy intentions. For greater explanatory power, we also include formal sanctions, shame, and moral beliefs in our model. Empirical results (n=183) show that neutralization techniques "appeal to higher loyalties" and "condemnation of the condemners" strongly predict software piracy intentions. In addition, shame and moral beliefs are also strong predictors. These findings suggest that anti-piracy efforts should involve educational interventions aimed at addressing these two neutralization techniques, rather than relying on formal sanctions.},

Summary Much attention has been devoted to how technological advancements have created a brave new workplace, revolutionzing the ways in which work is being carried out, and how employ-ees can improve their productivity and efficiency. However, the advent of technology has also opened up new avenues and opportunities for individuals to misbehave. This study focused on cyberloafing-the act of employees using their companies' internet access for personal pur-poses during work hours. Cyberloafing, thus, represents a form of production deviance. Using the theoretical frameworks offered by social exchange, organizational justice and neutraliza-tion, we examined the often-neglected dark side of the internet and the role that neutralization techniques play in facilitating this misbehavior at the workplace. Specifically, we developed a model which suggested that when individuals perceived their organizations to be distribu-tively, procedurally and interactionally unjust, they were likely to invoke the metaphor of the ledger as a neutralization technique to legitimize their subsequent engagement in the act of cyberloafing. Data were collected with the use of an electronic questionnaire and focus group interviews from 188 working adults with access to the internet at the workplace. Results of structural equation modelling provided empirical support for all of our hypotheses. Implications of our findings for organizational internet policies are discussed.},

abstract = {Relationship marketing typically requires organizations to continually collect customer information. Two distinct approaches co-exist to encourage customers to disclose information: reducing privacy concern and building trust, which in the past have been examined in isolation. In the present study, Regulatory Focus Theory was used to integrate both approaches and examine their distinct response behaviors concurrently. The findings were robust across two studies with different methods and contexts. As suggested in the proposed model, trust and privacy concern were the two central mediating variables with differentiated effects on promotion and prevention-focused behaviors. Specifically, trust mediated fairness perceptions on promotion-focused behaviors (i.e., relational behavior, relationship investment and repatronage intentions), whereas privacy concern mediated fairness perceptions on prevention-focused behaviors (i.e., defensive, deflective and disruptive behaviors). Implications for theory and practice are discussed.},

A group of high-achieving students were interviewed and it was found that each of the five techniques of neutralization was in fact advanced as a way of coping with the stigma, or the rate-busting portion, of their status.},

abstract = {Studies have argued that misbehaviour by customers is becoming increas-ingly prevalent in certain sectors. However, online consumer misbehaviour is com-paratively under-researched. The focus of the current study is peer-to-peer activities, including copying music, movies, software or video games: a phenomenon which affects the entertainment sector as a whole and costs the industry billions of pounds each year. Neutralization theory provides a potentially fruitful perspective from which to explore consumer justifications and rationalizations for their online misbehaviour. The aim of this paper is to explore the extent to which peer-to-peer users employ tech-niques of neutralization to justify prior-to behaviour or rationalize their activities post behaviour. First, a review of online customer misbehaviour is provided, followed by an overview of existing research into the techniques of neutralization. Following a dis-cussion of the research methods employed, findings regarding the peer-to-peer online misbehaviours and neutralization techniques are presented. Data analysis reveals that peer-to-peer file-sharers employ (often multiple) techniques of neutralization in order to pre-justify or post-event rationalize their activities, including: denial of vic-tim; denial of injury; denial of responsibility; claim of normality; claim of relative acceptability; justification by comparison; and appeal to higher loyalties. The paper concludes with a series of implications for both theory and practice.},

Abstract Purpose – This paper aims to examine the influence of organization culture on the effectiveness of implementing information security management (ISM). Design/methodology/approach – Based on a literature review, a model of the relationship between organizational culture and ISM was formulated, and both organizational culture characteristics and ISM effectiveness were measured empirically to investigate how various organizational culture traits influenced ISM principles, by administrating questionnaires to respondents in organizations with significant use of information systems. Findings – Four regression models were derived to quantify the impacts of organizational culture traits on the effectiveness of implementing ISM. Whilst the control-oriented organizational culture traits, effectiveness and consistency, have strong effect on the ISM principles of confidentiality, integrity, availability and accountability, the flexibility-oriented organizational culture traits, cooperativeness and innovativeness, are not significantly associated with the ISM principles with one exception that cooperativeness is negatively related to confidentiality. Research limitations/implications – The sample is limited to the organizational factors in Taiwan. It is suggested to replicate this study in other countries to reconfirm the result before adopting its general implications. Owing to the highly intrusive nature of ISM surveys, a cautious approach with rapport and trust is a key success factor in conducting empirical studies on ISM. Practical implications – A culture conducive to information security practice is extremely important for organizations since the human dimension of information security cannot totally be solved by technical and management measures. For understanding and improving the organization behavior with regard to information security, enterprises may look into organizational culture and examine how it affects the effectiveness of implementing ISM. Originality/value – A research model was proposed to study the impacts of organizational factors on ISM, after a broad survey on related researches. The validated model and its corresponding study results can be referenced by enterprise managers and decision makers to make favorable tactics for achieving their goals of ISM – mitigating information security risks.},

The results indicate that employees' compliance intention is the result of competing influences of perceived benefits, formal sanctions, and security risks. Furthermore, the effect of sanction severity is found to be moderated by personal norms.},

research on IS security has received increasing attention from IS scholars, little empirical research
has examined this problem. To address this research gap, the authors test a model based on Rational Choice
Theory (RCT)—a prominent criminological theory not yet applied in IS—which explains, in terms of a utilitarian
calculation, an individual's decision to commit a violation. Empirical results show that the effects of
informal sanctions, moral beliefs, and perceived benefits convincingly explain employee IS security policy
violations, while the effect of formal sanctions is insignificant. Based on these findings, the authors discuss
several implications for research and practice.},

In the first section the authors present a background about information security practices at work. Then, the authors present a research approach based on social cognitive theory applied in the information security context within organizations to address the individual and environmental factors that explain information security behavior of end users. The objective of the literature review is to describe the definition and operationalization of constructs such as information security awareness and information security practice as the mediating and dependent variables, and the independent variables of support within the organization, encouragement by others, others' use as environmental factors in the information security context; and finally, self-efficacy and outcome expectations as the individual factors. A research model with a set of propositions is presented to improve the understanding of the personal and environmental factors that influence the effective security practices of organizational employees.

abstract = {Purpose: To identify variables that influence compliance with information security policies of organizations and to identify how important these variables are. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of empirical studies described in extant literature is performed. This review found 29 studies meeting its inclusion criterion. The investigated variables in these studies and the effect size reported for them were extracted and analysed. Findings: In the 29 studies more than 60 variables have been studied in relation to security policy compliance and incompliance. Unfortunately, no clear winners can be found among the variables or the theories they are drawn from. Each of the variables only explain a small part of the variation in people's behaviour and when a variable has been investigated in multiple studies the findings often show a considerable variation. Research limitations/implications: It is possible that the disparate findings of the reviewed studies can be explained by the sampling methods used in the studies, the treatment/control of extraneous variables and interplay between variables. These aspects ought to be addressed in future research efforts Practical implications: For decision makers who seek guidance on how to best achieve compliance with their information security policies should recognize that a large number of variables probably influence employees' compliance. In addition, both their influence strength and interplay is uncertain and largely unknown. Originality/value: This is the first systematic review of research on variables that influence compliance with information security policies of organizations.},

In the context given by the headquarters of a large European banking organization, this single case study investigates whether individual behavioral compliance with the information security policy is influenced by accumulated security information and information security awareness embedded within the theory of reasoned action in an extended norms approach. We collected empirical data through a three-staged process in which we conducted semi-structured interviews, implemented a survey to test the developed research hypotheses, and engaged in interactive presentations to discuss the results. In particular, the qualitative interviews strengthened internal validity of survey constructs related to neutralization techniques and internal channel use for information acquisition. We found that the attitude toward information security policy compliance, and not only social norms but also personal norms related to neutralization techniques, are all significant variables potentially mitigating the knowing-doing gap reported in related information security research. Besides emphasizing the importance of extended norms, which should be accounted for in information security awareness programs, we also highlight the use of internal and external channels to acquire information as initial drivers of awareness. The empirical findings provide implications to practice and advance theoretical development by generally supporting the developed model that accounts for compliant information security behavior at an international bank.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Organizations and individuals are increasingly impacted by misuses of information that result from security lapses. Most of the cumula-tive research on information security has investigated the technical side of this critical issue, but securing organizational systems has its grounding in personal behavior. The fact remains that even with implementing mandatory controls, the application of computing defenses has not kept pace with abusers' attempts to undermine them. Studies of information security contravention behaviors have focused on some aspects of security lapses and have provided some behavioral recommendations such as punishment of offenders or ethics training. While this research has provided some insight on information security contravention, they leave incomplete our understanding of the omission of information security measures among people who know how to protect their systems but fail to do so. Yet carelessness with information and failure to take avail-able precautions contributes to significant civil losses and even to crimes. Explanatory theory to guide research that might help to answer important questions about how to treat this omission prob-lem lacks empirical testing. This empirical study uses protection motivation theory to articulate and test a threat control model to val-idate assumptions and better understand the ''knowing-doing " gap, so that more effective interventions can be developed.},

We developed a new multi-theory based model that explained employees' adherence to security policies. The paradigm combines elements from the Protection Motivation Theory, the Theory of Reasoned Action, and the Cognitive Evaluation Theory. We validated the model by using a sample of 669 responses from four corporations in Finland. The SEM-based results showed that perceived severity of potential information security threats, employees' belief as to whether they can apply and adhere to information security policies, perceived vulnerability to potential security threats, employees' attitude toward complying with information security policies, and social norms toward complying with these policies had a significant and positive effect on the employees' intention to comply with information security policies. Intention to comply with information security policies also had a significant impact on actual compliance with these policies. High level managers must warn employees of the importance of information security and why it is necessary to carry out these policies. In addition, employees should be provided with security education and hands on training.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To determine how patients and physicians balance the perceived benefits and harms of sharing electronic health data for patient care and for secondary purposes. 

DESIGN
Before-after survey of patients and providers in practices using electronic medical records (EMRs) enrolled in a clinical trial in Ontario, Canada. 

MEASUREMENTS
Outcomes were measured using the Health Information Privacy Questionnaire (HIPQ) at baseline and end of study. Thirteen questions in 4 general domains investigated attitudes towards the privacy of EMRs, outsider's use of patient's health information, the sharing of patient's information within the health care system, and the overall perception of benefits versus harms of computerization in health care. 

RESULTS
511 patients (mean age 60.3 years, 49.6{\%} female) and 46 physicians (mean age 47.2 years, 37.0{\%} female) participated. Most ({\textgreater}90{\%}) supported the computerized sharing of the patient's health records among their health care professionals and to provide clinical advice. Fewer agreed that the patient's de-identified information should be shared outside of the health care circle ({\textless}70{\%}). Only a minority of either group supported the notion that computerized records can be keep more private than paper records (38–50{\%}). Overall, a majority (58{\%} patients, 70{\%} physicians) believed that the benefits of computerization were greater than the risks of confidentiality loss. This was especially true for patients who were frequent computer users. 

DISCUSSION
While these primary care physicians and their patients valued the clinical features of EMRs, a substantial minority have concerns about the secondary use of de-identified information.},

Although researchers have started to focus on behavioral models to explain and predict human behavior, there is limited empirical research about the influence of smartphone users' individual differences on the usage of security measures. The aim of this study is to examine the influence of individual differences on cognitive determinants of behavioral intention to use security measures. Individual differences are measured by the Five-Factor Model; cognitive determinants of behavioral intention are adapted from the validated behavioral models theory of planned behavior and technology acceptance model. An explorative, quantitative survey of 435 smartphone users is served as data basis. The results suggest that multiple facets of smartphone user's personalities significantly affect the cognitive determinants, which indicate the behavioral intention to use security measures. From these findings, practical and theoretical implications for companies, organizations, and researchers are derived and discussed.},

abstract = {The Health Belief Model (HBM; Rosenstock, 1966) was constructed to explain which beliefs should be targeted in communication campaigns to cause positive health behaviors. The model specifies that if individuals perceive a negative health outcome to be severe, perceive them-selves to be susceptible to it, perceive the benefits to behaviors that reduce the likelihood of that outcome to be high, and perceive the barriers to adopting those behaviors to be low, then the behavior is likely for those individuals. A meta-analysis of 18 studies (2,702 subjects) was con-ducted to determine whether measures of these beliefs could longitudinally predict behavior. Benefits and barriers were consistently the strongest predictors. The length of time between measurement of the HBM beliefs and behavior, prevention versus treatment behaviors, and drug-taking regimens versus other behaviors were identified as moderators of the HBM vari-ables' predictive power. Based on the weakness of two of the predictors, the continued use of the direct effects version of the HBM is not recommended. According to Rosenstock's (1966) seminal work on the Health Belief Model (HBM), the original goal of the researchers who developed the model was to focus the efforts of those who sought to improve public health by understanding why people failed to adopt a preventa-tive health measure. The model's ability to explain and predict a variety of behaviors associated with positive health outcomes has been successfully replicated count-less times (Janz {\&} Becker, 1984). The model has also been used to develop many successful health communi-cation interventions by targeting messages at the HBM variables to change health behaviors (Sohl {\&} Moyer, 2007). The individual elements of the model, however, have varied in their ability to predict health behaviors (Harrison, Mullen, {\&} Green, 1992). In order to resolve the uncertainty concerning which elements of the model are most strongly related to health behaviors, this review presents the results of a meta-analysis of the HBM variables.},

Findings suggested that human and organizational factors play a significant role in the development of CIS vulnerabilities and emphasized the relationship complexities among human and organizational factors. The factors were categorized into 9 areas: external influences, human error, management, organization, performance and resource manage-ment, policy issues, technology, and training. Security practitioners and management should be aware of the multifarious roles of human and organizational factors and CIS vulnerabilities and that CIS vulnerabilities are not the sole result of a technological problem or programming mistake.

abstract = {The information systems (IS) field continues to debate the relative importance of rigor and relevance in its research. While the pursuit of rigor in research is important, we argue that further effort is needed to improve practical relevance, not only in terms of topics, but also by ensuring contextual relevance. While content validity is often performed rigorously, validated survey instruments may still lack contextual relevance and be out of touch with practice. We argue that IS behavioral research can improve its practical relevance without loss of rigor by carefully addressing a number of contextual issues in instrumentation design. In this opinion article, we outline five guidelines – relating to both rigor and relevance – designed to increase the contextual relevance of field survey research, using case examples from the area of IS security. They are: (1) inform study respondents that a behavior is an ISP violation, (2) measure specific examples of ISP violations, (3) ensure that ISP violations are important ISP problems in practice, (4) ensure the applicability of IS security violations to the organizational context, and (5) consider the appropriate level of specificity and generalizability for instrumentation. We review previous behavioral research on IS security and show that no existing study meets more than three of these five guidelines. By applying these guidelines where applicable, IS scholars can increase the contextual relevance of their instrumentation, yielding results more likely to address important problems in practice.},

One of these critical areas is the human aspect, where investigation of employees' behaviors has emerged as an important topic. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of all empirical studies published on this topic. The review will highlight the theoretical and methodological development and the dissemination of related empirical studies in academic journals throughout the years. At the end of the review, future research considerations are discussed and shared.},

abstract = {In organizations, users' compliance with information security policies (ISP) is crucial for minimizing information security (IS) incidents. To improve users' compliance, IS managers have implemented IS awareness (ISA) programs, which are systematically planned interventions to continuously transport security information to a target audience. The underlying research analyzes IS managers' efforts to design effective ISA programs by comparing current design recommendations suggested by scientific literature with actual design practices of ISA programs in three banks. Moreover, this study addresses how users perceive ISA programs and related implications for compliant IS behavior. Empirically, we utilize a multiple case design to investigate three banks from Central and Eastern Europe. In total, 33 semi-structured interviews with IS managers and users were conducted and internal materials of ISA programs such as intranet messages and posters were also considered. The paper contributes to IS compliance research by offering a comparative and holistic view on ISA program design practices. Moreover, we identified influences on users' perceptions centering on IS risks, responsibilities, ISP importance and knowledge, and neutralization behaviors. Finally, the study raises propositions regarding the relationship of ISA program designs and factors, which are likely to influence users' ISP compliance.},

abstract = {Small businesses thrive in the developing economy of South Africa and address the important issue of unemployment and poverty that exists in the country. A large number of these businesses can be found in the province of Gauteng due to the large and diverse economic contribution the province delivers to the economy of South Africa. With the increased use of Information Systems (IS) by small businesses across the Gauteng province and in South Africa generally, there is increasingly constant exposure to information security risks. Interestingly, standards such as NISTIR 7621, specifically tailored to small businesses and which could offer great insights on how to manage security risks, are by and large not followed to the letter. We find in our work that owners-managers prefer to handle matters of security 'in their own terms' and apply neutralization (termed rationalization) techniques to overcome the effects posed by security threats. We used four instrumental cases for this purpose. Our findings suggest that neutralization manifests as values held by owners-managers and this can often create the unintended consequences of exacerbating security risk to these small businesses.},

Depending on the theory of planned behavior, members' attitudes towards compliance, as well as normative belief and self-efficacy, were believed to determine the intention to comply with the information security policy. Neutralization theory, a prominent theory in criminology, could be expected to provide the explanation for information system security policy violations. Based on the protection motivation theory, it was inferred that the expected efficacy could have an impact on intentions of compliance. By the above logical reasoning, the integrative behavioral model and eight hypotheses could be derived. Data were collected by conducting a survey; 194 out of 207 questionnaires were available. The test of the causal model was conducted by PLS. The reliability, validity, and model fit were found to be statistically significant. The results of the hypotheses tests showed that seven of the eight hypotheses were acceptable. The theoretical implications of this study are as follows: (1) the study is expected to play a role of the baseline for future research about organization members' compliance with the information security policy, (2) the study attempted an interdisciplinary approach by combining psychology and information system security research, and (3) the study suggested concrete operational definitions of influencing factors for information security policy compliance through a comprehensive theoretical review.

Many scholars tried to explain the violation and suggested ways to prevent user from violating information security policy. Methods/Statistical Analysis: While neutralization is used to explain the behavior of juvenile delinquency, neutralization is utilized to show the behavior of the violation in information security. Neutralization was used to explain the software piracy and the violation of information security. This study tries to investigate the extensive literature review explaining the violation behavior of information security policy and summarizes the important mainstreams giving the implications. This paper invests theoretical ground on neutralization. Findings: This study suggests the extensive adaptability of neutralization techniques applied in the information security policy. Individuals consider the violation of information security the minor rule breaking behavior. Neutralization has been utilized to explain the minor deviant behavior, so it also can be accepted to explain the various violation behaviors in the field of information security policy. Improvements/Applications: Neutralization can be useful in understanding the violation behavior of information security policy and used in designing security management systems in various organizations.},

One hundred subjects completed questionnaires including measures of attitudes and normative beliefs toward single behaviors and toward dichotomous and multiple behavioral choices. Consistent with decision theory notions it was found that behavioral intentions in a choice situation could be predicted with higher accuracy by considering attitudes toward all behavioral alternatives than by using the attitude toward only one of the possible actions. In support of the prediction based on Fishbein's model it was found that behavioral intentions for single acts as well as for acts in dichotomous and multiple choice situations were a function not only of attitudes toward the acts but also of normative beliefs with respect to these behaviors.},

abstract = {We introduce a new methodology for identifying the factors that drive employee security behaviors in organizations, based on a well-known paradigm from psychology, the Johari Window. An analysis of 93 interviews with staff from 2 multinational organizations revealed that security behavior is driven by a combination of risk understanding and emotional stance towards security policy. Furthermore, we found that a quantitative analysis of these dimensions is capable of differentiating between the staff populations of the two organizations. Organization B showed a healthier set of security behaviors, as a result of its employees having better risk understanding and a more positive emotional stance. The framework distinguishes between 16 theoretical behavioral types, (3 of which are rule breakers, excuse makers and security champions). It can be used to identify groups of employees that potentially pose a risk to the organization, as well as those with beneficial skills and expertise. This allows highly specific messages to be targeted to change the risk perception and emotional stance of such groups. Assuming the organization has ensured security hygiene (i.e. its policies can be complied with in the context of productive activity), this can shift behavior towards compliance. Our framework thus offers diagnostic and intervention-shaping tools for the next step in improving security culture.},

abstract = {Social computing technologies typically have multiple features that allow users to reveal their personal information to other users. Such self-disclosure (SD) behavior is generally considered positive and beneficial in interpersonal communication and relationships. Using a newly proposed model based on social exchange theory, this paper investigates and empirically validates the relationships between SD technology use and culture. In particular, we explore the effects of culture on information privacy concerns and the desire for online interpersonal awareness, which influence attitudes toward, intention to use, and actual use of SD technologies. Our model was tested using arguably the strongest social computing technology for online SD instant messaging (IM) with users from China and the United States. Our findings reveal that cross-cultural dimensions are significant predictors of information privacy concerns and desire for online awareness, which are, in turn, found to be predictors of attitude toward, intention to use, and actual use of IM. Overall, our proposed model is applicable to both cultures. Our findings enhance the theoretical understanding of the effects of culture and privacy concerns on SD technologies and provide practical suggestions for developers of SD technologies, such as adding additional control features to applications.},

Research shows that employees use neutralization techniques to rationalize their ISP violating behaviors; it is therefore important to understand what leads to and influences these neutralization techniques. The authors' study draws upon social exchange theory to develop a set of factors that drive employees' neutralization of ISP violations. The model specifies previously untested relationships between job satisfaction, organizational commitment, role conflict, role ambiguity, and neutralization techniques. Using a sample of Malaysian banking employees, the authors found a positive relationship between role conflict and neutralization of ISP violations, whereas organizational commitment was negatively related to neutralization in this context. The authors' findings offer fresh insights for scholars and practitioners in dealing with the problem of employees' intentional ISP violations while extending the reach of neutralization theory beyond North American and European cultures.},

abstract = {Companies' information security efforts are often threatened by employee negligence and insider breach. To deal with these insider issues, this study draws on the compliance theory and the general deterrence theory to propose a research model in which the relations among coercive control, which has been advocated by scholars and widely practiced by companies; remunerative control, which is generally miss- ing in both research and practice; and certainty of control are studied. A Web-based field experiment involving real-world employees in their natural settings was used to empirically test the model. While lending further support to the general deter- rence theory, our findings highlight that reward enforcement, a remunerative control mechanism in the information systems security context, could be an alternative for organizations where sanctions do not successfully prevent violation. The significant interactions between punishment and reward found in the study further indicate a need for a more comprehensive enforcement system that should include a reward enforcement scheme through which the organizational moral standards and values are established or reemphasized. The findings of this study can potentially be used to guide the design of more effective security enforcement systems that encompass remunerative control mechanisms.},

abstract = {Employees' failure to comply with information systems security policies is a major concern for information technology security managers. In efforts to understand this problem, IS security researchers have traditionally viewed violations of IS security policies through the lens of deterrence theory. In this article, we show that neutralization theory, a theory prominent in Criminology but not yet applied in the context of IS, provides a compelling explanation for IS security policy violations and offers new insight into how employees rationalize this behavior. In doing so, we propose a theoretical model in which the effects of neutralization techniques are tested alongside those of sanctions described by deterrence theory. Our empirical results highlight neutralization as an important factor to take into account with regard to developing and implementing organizational security policies and practices.},

abstract = {Background: Human beings are an integral part of com-puter security, whether we actively participate or simply build the systems. Despite this importance, understand-ing users and their interaction with security is a blind spot for most security practitioners and designers. Aim: Define principles for conducting experiments into usable security and privacy, to improve study robustness and usefulness. Data: The authors' experiences conducting several re-search projects complemented with a literature survey. Method: We extract principles based on relevance to the advancement of the state of the art. We then justify our choices by providing published experiments as cases of where the principles are and are not followed in practice to demonstrate the impact. Each principle is a discipline-specific instantiation of desirable experiment-design ele-ments as previously established in the domain of philos-ophy of science. Results: Five high-priority principles – (i) give par-ticipants a primary task; (ii) incorporate realistic risk; (iii) avoid priming the participants; (iv) perform double-blind experiments whenever possible and (v) think care-fully about how meaning is assigned to the terms threat model, security, privacy, and usability. Conclusion: The principles do not replace researcher acumen or experience, however they can provide a valu-able service for facilitating evaluation, guiding younger researchers and students, and marking a baseline com-mon language for discussing further improvements.},

@article{Warkentin2009,
abstract = {Modern global economic and political conditions, technological infra-structure, and socio-cultural developments all contribute to an increas-ingly turbulent and dynamic environment for organizations, which maintain information systems (IS) for use in business, government, and other domains. As our institutions (economic, political, military, legal, social) become increasingly global and inter-connected; as we rely more on automated control systems to provide us with energy and services; and as we establish internet-based mechanisms for coordinating this global interaction, we introduce greater vulnerability to our systems and processes. This increased dependence on cyberspace also inflates our vulnerability – isolation is no longer an option. Perhaps no aspect of this phenomenon is as alarming and challenging as the need to understand and address the various risks to the security of the IS on which we depend. Security risks arise from multiple sources and motivations. In a taxonomy developed by Loch, et al. (1992), threats to IS security were categorized into four dimensions – those that are external (both human and non-human) and those that are internal (human and non-human). The research focus of those in engineering and computer science is predominantly on the external threats, and a plethora of artifacts have been developed to protect the organization's perimeter (e.g., intrusion detection systems, firewalls, anti-malware software, etc.). Within the MIS research tradition, there has been a significant effort to investigate human perpetrators of IS security threat, especially from those who are within the organization (behind the firewall, as it were). In the Loch, et al. (1992) framework, these sources of threat were further characterized by their intention (intentional vs accidental). Much of the focus within the behavioral research community has been on IS security policy non-compliance by employees. Such acts may be intention-based, willful, malicious violation (such as sabotage, data theft, data destruction, etc.) or they may be unintentional or accidental actions, including forgetting to change passwords, failing to log off before leaving a workstation, or careless discarding of sensitive information rather than shredding it. Warkentin (1995) expanded the taxonomy to include low-grade and high-grade threats; the latter being a purposeful individual or organization who will seek obscure vulnerabilities and inflict far greater economic damage by maintaining intrusions for the maximum long-term gain. So risks from intentional human activity are especially dangerous, especially in a world full of new, more sophisticated hackers, spies, terrorists, and criminal organizations which are committed to coordinated global attacks on our information assets in order to achieve their goals. Some malicious individuals wish to inflict damage and loss for political reasons or for military purposes, some are seeking 'trade secrets' and proprietary corporate information, and others are seeking financial information with which to conduct fraud, identity theft, and other criminal acts. Another category of risks has arisen from new classes of},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Past research on information technology (IT) security training and awareness has focused on informing employees about security policies and formal sanctions for violating those policies. However, research suggests that deterrent sanctions may not be the most powerful influencer of employee violations. Often, employees use rationalizations, termed neutralization techniques, to overcome the effects of deterrence when deciding whether or not to violate a policy. Therefore, neutralization techniques often are stronger than sanctions in predicting employee behavior. For this study, we examine " denial of injury, " " metaphor of the ledger, " and " defense of necessity " as relevant justifications for violating password policies that are commonly used in organizations as used in (Siponen and Vance, 2010). Initial research on neutralization in IS security has shown that results are consistent regardless of which type of neutralization is considered (Siponen and Vance, 2010). In this study, we investigate whether IT security communication focused on mitigating neutral-ization, rather than deterrent sanctions, can reduce intentions to violate security policies. Additionally, considering the effects of message framing in persuading individuals against security policy violations are largely unexamined, we predict that negatively-framed communication will be more persuasive than positively-framed communication. We test our hypotheses using the factorial survey method. Our results suggest that security communication and training that focuses on neutralization techniques is just as effective as communication that focuses on deterrent sanctions in persuading employees not to violate policies, and that both types of framing are equally effective.},

We present the creation of such a tool. We surveyed the most common com-puter security advice that experts offer to end-users in order to construct a set of Likert scale questions to probe the ex-tent to which respondents claim to follow this advice. Using these questions, we iteratively surveyed a pool of 3,619 com-puter users to refine our question set such that each question was applicable to a large percentage of the population, ex-hibited adequate variance between respondents, and had high reliability (i.e., desirable psychometric properties). After per-forming both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, we identified a 16-item scale consisting of four sub-scales that measures attitudes towards choosing passwords, device securement, staying up-to-date, and proactive awareness.},

As predicted, we found that individuals who scored high on a lack of perseverance were more likely to share passwords. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found younger [corrected] people and individuals who score high on self-monitoring were more likely to share passwords.

Results show that perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, and self-efficacy are determinants of email related security behavior. Perceived severity moderates the effects of perceived benefits, general security orientation, cues to action, and self-efficacy on security behavior.},

abstract = {Purpose: To identify variables that influence compliance with information security policies of organizations and to identify how important these variables are. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of empirical studies described in extant literature is performed. This review found 29 studies meeting its inclusion criterion. The investigated variables in these studies and the effect size reported for them were extracted and analysed. Findings: In the 29 studies more than 60 variables have been studied in relation to security policy compliance and incompliance. Unfortunately, no clear winners can be found among the variables or the theories they are drawn from. Each of the variables only explain a small part of the variation in people's behaviour and when a variable has been investigated in multiple studies the findings often show a considerable variation. Research limitations/implications: It is possible that the disparate findings of the reviewed studies can be explained by the sampling methods used in the studies, the treatment/control of extraneous variables and interplay between variables. These aspects ought to be addressed in future research efforts Practical implications: For decision makers who seek guidance on how to best achieve compliance with their information security policies should recognize that a large number of variables probably influence employees' compliance. In addition, both their influence strength and interplay is uncertain and largely unknown. Originality/value: This is the first systematic review of research on variables that influence compliance with information security policies of organizations.},

abstract = {While there is a rich body of literature on user acceptance of technologies with positive outcomes, little is known about user behavior toward what we call protective technologies: information technologies that protect data and systems from disturbances such as viruses, unauthorized access, disruptions, spyware, and others. In this paper, we present the results of a study of user behavioral intention toward protective technologies based on the framework of the theory of planned behavior. We find that awareness of the threats posed by negative technologies is a strong predictor of user behavioral intention toward the use of protective technologies. More interestingly, in the presence of awareness, the influence of subjective norm on individual behavioral intention is weaker among basic technology users but stronger among advanced technology users. Furthermore, while our results are consistent with many of the previously established relationships in the context of positive technologies, we find that the determinants " perceived ease of use " and " computer self-efficacy " are no longer significant in the context of protective technologies. We believe that this result highlights the most significant difference between positive technologies and protective technologies: while the former are used for their designed utilities, for which usefulness and ease of use have a significant impact, the latter are used out of fear of negative consequences, for which awareness becomes a key determinant. We discussed the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. The findings of this study extend the theory of planned behavior to the context of protective technologies and shed insights on designing effective information security policies, practices, and protective technologies for organizations and society.},

@article{Ajzen1985,
abstract = {There appears to be general agreement among social psychologists that most human behavior is goal-directed (e. g., Heider, 1958 ; Lewin, 1951). Being neither capricious nor frivolous, human social behavior can best be described as following along lines of more or less well-formulated plans. Before attending a concert, for example, a person may extend an invitation to a date, purchase tickets, change into proper attire, call a cab, collect the date, and proceed to the concert hall. Most, if not all, of these activities will have been designed in advance; their execution occurs as the plan unfolds. To be sure, a certain sequence of actions can become so habitual or routine that it is performed almost automatically, as in the case of driving from home to work or playing the piano. Highly developed skills of this kind typically no longer require conscious formulation of a behavioral plan. Nevertheless, at least in general outline, we are normally well aware of the actions required to attain a certain goal. Consider such a relatively routine behavior as typing a letter. When setting this activity as a goal, we anticipate the need to locate a typewriter, insert a sheet of paper, adjust the margins, formulate words and sentences, strike the appropriate keys, and so forth. Some parts of the plan are more routine, and require less conscious thought than others, but without an explicit or implicit plan to guide the required sequence of acts, no letter would get typed.},

@article{Ajzen1991,
abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behav-ioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescahng of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past be-havior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited avail-able evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reli-ability. 0 1991 Academic Press, Inc. As every student of psychology knows, explaining human behavior in all its complexity is a difficult task. It can be approached at many levels, from concern with physiological processes at one extreme to concentra-tion on social institutions at the other. Social and personality psycholo-gists have tended to focus on an intermediate level, the fully functioning individual whose processing of available information mediates the effects of biological and environmental factors on behavior. Concepts referring to behavioral dispositions, such as social attitude and personality trait, have played an important role in these attempts to predict and explain human behavior (see Ajzen, 1988; Campbell, 1963; Sherman {\&} Fazio, 1983). Various theoretical frameworks have been proposed to deal with the psychological processes involved.

Firstly, they are not comprehensive in their coverage and furthermore, tending to rather address the processes needed for successfully implementing the information security policy.

abstract = {Many information security specialists believe that promoting good end user behaviors and constraining bad end user behaviors provide one important method for making information security effective within organizations. Because of the important of end user security-related behaviors, having a systematic viewpoint on the different kinds of behavior that end users enact could provide helpful benefits for managers, auditors, information technologists, and others with an interest in assessing and/or influencing end user behavior. In the present article, we describe our efforts to work with subject matter experts to develop a taxonomy of end user security-related behaviors, test the consistency of that taxonomy, and use behaviors from that taxonomy to conduct a U.S. survey of an important set of end user behaviors. We interviewed 110 individuals who possessed knowledge of end user security-related behaviors, conducted a behavior rating exercise with 49 information technology subject matter experts, and ran a U.S. survey of 1167 end users to obtain self-reports of their password-related behaviors. Results suggested that six categories of end user security-related behaviors appeared to fit well on a two-dimensional map where one dimension captured the level of technical knowledge needed to enact the behavior and another dimension captured the intentionality of the behavior (including malicious, neutral, and benevolent intentions). Our U.S. survey of non-malicious, low technical knowledge behaviors related to password creation and sharing showed that password “hygiene” was generally poor but varied substantially across different organization types (e.g., military organizations versus telecommunications companies). Further, we documented evidence that good password hygiene was related to training, awareness, monitoring, and motivation.},

abstract = {Secure management of information systems is crucially important in information intensive organizations. Although most organizations have long been using security technologies, it is well known that technology tools alone are not sufficient. Thus, the area of end-user security behaviors in organizations has gained an increased attention. In information security observing end-user security behaviors is challenging. Moreover, recent studies have shown that the end users have divergent security views. The inability to monitor employee IT security behaviors and divergent views regarding security policies, in our view, provide a setting where the principal agent paradigm applies. In this paper, we develop and test a theoretical model of the incentive effects of penalties, pressures and perceived effectiveness of employee actions that enhances our understanding of employee compliance to information security policies. Based on 312 employee responses from 77 organizations, we empirically validate and test the model. Our findings suggest that security behaviors can be influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. Pressures exerted by subjective norms and peer behaviors influence employee information security behaviors. Intrinsic motivation of employee perceived effectiveness of their actions was also found to play an important role in security policy compliance intentions. In analyzing the penalties, certainty of detection was found to be significant while surprisingly, severity of punishment was found to have a negative effect on security behavior intentions. We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and practice.},

The first situation, level of descriptiveness, is deemed to be questionable because it may prove eventually that end‐users fail to internalize target goals and do not follow security guidelines, for example – which is inadequate. Moreover, the role of motivation in the area of information security is not considered seriously enough, even though its role has been widely recognised. To tackle such weaknesses, this paper constructs a conceptual foundation for information systems/organizational security awareness.

This has led to an increased need for information security management to safeguard against loss/alteration or theft of the firm's important information. SMEs tend to be concerned with vulnerabilities from external threats, although industry research suggests that a substantial proportion of security incidents originate from insiders within the firm. Hence, physical preventative measures such as antivirus software and firewalls are proving to solve only part of the problem as the employees controlling them do not have adequate information security knowledge. This tends to expose the firm to costly mistakes that can be made by na{\"{i}}ve/uninformed employees. This paper presents an information security awareness process that seeks to cultivate positive security behaviours using the behavioural intentions models i.e. the Theory of Reasoned Action and the Protection Motivation Theory.

We argue that the non-adoption of end-to-end encryption might not be entirely due to usability issues identified by Whitten and Tygar in their seminal paper " Why Johnny Can't Encrypt " . Our in-vestigation revealed a number of fundamental issues such as incomplete threat models, misaligned incentives, and a general absence of understanding of the email architecture. From our data and related research literature we found ev-idence of a number of potential explanations for the low uptake of end-to-end encryption. This suggests that merely increasing the availability and usability of encryption functionality in email clients will not automatically encourage in-creased deployment by email users. We shall have to focus, first, on building comprehensive end-user mental models related to email, and email security. We conclude by suggesting directions for future research.},

This study first analyzes relevant researches on the intention to use such systems as the basis for the questionnaire design, then conducts questionnaire survey among district hospital nurses, head directors, and other related personnel. After the questionnaires are collected, SEM is used to analyze the data. The analysis shows that the proposed factors positively influence users' intention to use a healthcare system. Information, service and system quality influence user's intention through the mediating constructs, perceived usefulness and perceived ease-of-use. Managerial implications are provided accordingly. Suggestions for introducing healthcare information system are then provided as well.},

abstract = {Research from the fields of criminology and social psychology suggests that the deterrent effect of security countermeasures is not uniform across individu-als. In this study, we examine whether certain individual characteristics (i.e., computer self-efficacy) or work arrangement (i.e., virtual status) moderate the influence of security policies, security education, training, and awareness (SETA) program, and computer monitoring on information systems misuse. The results suggest that computer savvy individuals are less deterred by SETA programs and computer monitoring, while these coun-termeasures are also less influential (from a deterrence perspective) on employees that spend more working days outside the office. Implications for both the research and practice of information security are discussed.},

abstract = {Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), this research investigates two factors that drive an employee to comply with requirements of the information security policy (ISP) of her organization with regards to protecting information and technology resources: an employee's information security awareness (ISA) and her perceived fairness of the requirements of the ISP. Our results, which is based on the PLS analysis of data collected from 464 participants, show that ISA and perceived fairness positively affect attitude, and in turn attitude positively affects intention to comply. ISA also has an indirect impact on attitude since it positively influences perceived fairness. As organizations strive to get their employees to follow their information security rules and regulations, our study sheds light on the role of an employee's ISA and procedural fairness with regards to security rules and regulations in the workplace.},

In the past few years, the growth of information on social networks (such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) has increased exponentially. Companies are harvesting this information with and without the knowledge of individuals. While the exchange of information and seamless interaction between individuals and groups has become an easy task, issues related to this exchange, such as information privacy and security, have created new challenges. This study investigated respondents' attitudes towards privacy on social networking sites. In addition, the study sought to ascertain whether socio-demographic variables and knowledge of privacy issues influence attitudes and privacy concerns towards using social computing sites.

Corporate reputation results from the firm's interactions with stakeholders, emphasizing the important role employees play in reputation management. However, employees are not necessarily aware of, or prepared for, this extra-role assignment, indicating a gap in research and a managerial challenge. The purpose of the present article is to identify how employees' awareness of their impact on their employers' reputation is influenced by pride, job satisfaction, affective commitment, and perceived corporate reputation. An online survey of employees working for firms ranked in Fortune's America's Most Admired Companies Index provides empirical evidence. The findings underline the prominent effect pride in membership has regarding employees' awareness of their impact on corporate reputation. Study findings further deliver insights into opportunities and risks for managers who wish to use internal reputation building strategies to enhance corporate reputation.},

Global health curricula often include field experiences that involve crossing international and socio-cultural borders. Although global health training experiences offer potential ben- efits to trainees and to sending institutions, these experiences are sometimes problematic and raise ethical challenges. The Working Group on Ethics Guidelines for Global Health Training (WEIGHT) developed a set of guidelines for institu- tions, trainees, and sponsors of field-based global health training on ethics and best practices in this setting. Because only limited data have been collected within the context of existing global health training, the guidelines were informed by the published literature and the experience of WEIGHT members. The Working Group on Ethics Guidelines for Global Health Training encourages efforts to develop and implement a means of assessing the potential benefits and harms of global health training programs.},

abstract = {It is widely agreed that a large amount of information systems (IS) security incidents occur in the workplace because employees subvert existing IS Security Policy (ISSP). In order to understand the factors that constrain employees from deviance and violation of the organizational ISSP, past work has traditionally viewed this issue through the lens of formal deterrence mechanisms; we postulated that we could better explain employees' ISSP violation behaviours through considering both formal and informal control factors as well as through considering existing deterrence theory. We therefore developed a theoretical model based on both deterrence and social bond theories rooted in a social control perspective to better understand employee behaviour in this context. The model is validated using survey data of 185 employees. Our empirical results highlight that both formal and informal controls have a significant effect on employees' ISSP violation intentions. To be specific, employees' social bonding is found to have mixed impacts on the employee's intention to violate ISSP. Social pressures exerted by subjective norms and co-worker behaviours also significantly influence employees' ISSP violation intentions. In analyzing the formal sanctions, the perceived severity of sanctions was found to be significant while, perceived certainty of those sanctions was not. We discuss the key implications of our findings for managers and researchers and the implications for professional practice. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {To ensure that patient confidentiality is securely maintained, health ICT applications that contain sensitive personal information demand comprehensive privacy policies. Determining the adequacy of these policies to meet legal conformity together with clinical users and patient expectation is demanding in practice. Organisations and agencies looking to analyse their Privacy and Security policies can benefit from guidance provided by outside entities such as the Privacy Office of their State or Government together with law firms and ICT specialists. The advice given is not uniform and often open to different interpretations. Of greater concern is the possibility of overlooking any important aspects that later result in a data breach. Based on three case studies, this paper considers whether a more formal approach to privacy analysis could be taken that would help identify the full coverage of a Privacy Impact Analysis and determine the deficiencies with an organisation's current policies and approach. A diagrammatic model showing the relationships between Confidentiality, Privacy, Trust, Security and Safety is introduced. First the validity of this model is determined by mapping it against the real-world case studies taken from three healthcare services that depend on ICT. Then, by using software engineering methods, a formal mapping of the relationships is undertaken to identify a full set of policies needed to satisfy the model. How effective this approach may prove as a generic method for deriving a comprehensive set of policies in health ICT applications is finally discussed.},

abstract = {One of the key factors in successful information security management is the effective compliance of security policies and proper integration of “people”, “process” and “technology”. When it comes to the issue of “people”, this effectiveness can be achieved through several mechanisms, one of which is the security awareness training of employees. However, the outcomes should also be measured to see how successful and effective this training has been for the employees. In this study, an information security awareness project is implemented in a company both by training and by subsequent auditing of the effectiveness and success of this training (which focussed on password usage, password quality and compliance of employees with the password policies of the company). The project was conducted in a Turkish company with 2900 white-collar employees. Each employee took information security training including password usage. Also, there were several supporting awareness campaigns such as educational posters, animations and e-messages on the company Intranet, surveys and simple online quizzes. The project was carried out over a 12 month period and three password security strength audits were made during this period. The results were comparatively and statistically analysed. The results show us the effectiveness of the project and the impact of human awareness on the success of information security management programmes in companies. This study gives us some crucial results, facts and methods that can also be used as a guideline for further similar projects.},

abstract = {The key threat to information security is constituted by careless employees who do not comply with information security policies. To ensure that employees comply with organizations' information security procedures, a number of information security policy compliance measures have been proposed in the past. Prior research has criticized these measures as lacking theoretically and empirically grounded principles to ensure that employees comply with information security policies. To fill this gap in research, this paper advances a new model that explains employees' adherence to information security policies. In this model, we extend the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) by integrating the General Deterrence Theory (GDT) and the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) with PMT. To test this model, we collected data (N = 917) from four different companies. The results show that threat appraisal, self-efficacy and response efficacy have a significant impact on intention to comply with information security policies. Sanctions have a significant impact on actual compliance with information security policies. Intention to comply with information security policies also has a significant impact on actual compliance with information security policies.},

abstract = {Aims: Medical team members, especially nurses can play an active role in prevention and control of nosocomial infections. The aim of this study was evaluating the knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy of nursing staff in controlling nosocomial infections. Methods: This Cross-sectional study was done in 2010 on 135 nursing staff working in selected hospitals of Mashhad selected by census and purposive method. The data collection tool was a researcher-made questionnaire evaluating knowledge, attitude and self-efficacy in controlling hospital infections. Data was analyzed by SPSS 16 software using descriptive statistical methods and Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests. Results: 67.9{\%} of the nursing staff had average knowledge and 29.9{\%} had good knowledge about infection control. 90.4{\%} had positive attitude towards the perceived threats of nosocomial infections, 17.2{\%} were agreed with the perceived barriers of infections' prevention and control and 36.2{\%} were agreed with the perceived benefits of infection control. 25.2{\%} had average self-efficacy and 74.8{\%} had good self-efficacy. There was not significant relationship between knowledge and self-efficacy. In addition, there was no correlation between attitude and efficacy but there was a significant relationship between knowledge and gender (p{\textless}0.05). Conclusion: Nurses do not have appropriate knowledge about controlling nosocomial infections based on the findings of this study. Considering the important role of nurses in nosocomial infection control, training is necessary to increase nurses' knowledge and attitude in order to adopt appropriate health behaviors with positive attitude and more ability.},

It was found that the impact of phonological awareness and visual-spatial working memory, assessed at 5 years of age, was mediated by early QNC, which predicted math achievement in third grade. Importantly, and confirming our isolated number words hypothesis, phonological awareness had no impact on higher numerical competencies (i.e., when number words needed to be linked with quantities [QNC Level II and above]) but predicted basic numerical competencies (i.e., when number words were isolated from quantities [QNC Level I]), explaining the moderate relationship between early literacy development and the development of mathematical competencies. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This paper presents an evaluation of the societal impact of a simulation-based Serious Game. FloodSim was developed with the aim of raising awareness of issues surrounding flooding policy and citizen engagement in the UK. The game was played by a large number of users (N=25,701) in a period of 4 weeks. Quantitative and qualitative analyses (on a reduced data set) were carried out in order to explore the impact of FloodSim play in raising the general public awareness around flooding in the UK. The results suggest FloodSim was hugely successful in generating general public interest and there was evidence that (a) FloodSim increased awareness at a basic level and (b) that despite the simplicity of the simulation, players perceived FloodSim to be an accurate source of information about flood risk and prevention. This suggests that serious games such as FloodSim have potential to engage the public and raise awareness of societal issues. However, FloodSim only raised awareness at a basic level. It is suggested that more needs to be done to endow serious games with pedagogical principles and more care should be given to the accuracy of the information they convey. The appropriateness of games as an educational medium for raising awareness of complex, real-life issues should also be carefully considered. This study throws some light on the potential of simulation-based Serious Games to offer experiential learning, engage users with serious topics while raising public awareness and understanding of social issues such as flooding and related policymaking.

However, their potential impact on informing and engaging citizens on relevant issues has still been largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that visualizations displayed in public settings are able to increase social awareness and discourse by exposing underlying patterns in data that is submitted by citizens. We thus introduce the design and evaluation of Reveal-it!, a public, interactive projection that facilitates the comparison of the energy consumptions of individuals and communities. Our in-the-wild deployment in three distinct physical locations provided insights into: 1) how people responded to this form of display in different contexts; 2) how it influenced people's perception and discussion of individual and communal data; and 3) the implications for a public visualization as a tool for increasing awareness and discourse. We conclude by discussing emerging participant behaviors, as well as some challenges involved in facilitating a socially motivated crowd-sourced visualization in the public context.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Intentional insider misuse of information systems resources (i.e., IS misuse) represents a significant threat to organizations. For example, industry statistics suggest that between 50{\%}-75{\%} of security incidents originate from within an organization. Because of the large number of misuse incidents, it has become important to understand how to reduce such behavior. General deterrence theory suggests that certain controls can serve as deterrent mechanisms by increasing the perceived threat of punishment for IS misuse. This paper presents an extended deterrence theory model that combines work from criminology, social psychology, and information systems. The model posits that user awareness of security countermeasures directly influences the perceived certainty and severity of organizational sanctions associated with IS misuse, which leads to reduced IS misuse intention. The model is then tested on 269 computer users from eight different companies. The results suggest that three practices deter IS misuse: user awareness of security policies; security education, training, and aware ness (SETA) programs; and computer monitoring. The results also suggest that perceived severity of sanctions is more effective in reducing IS misuse than certainty of sanctions. Further, there is evidence that the impact of sanction perceptions vary based on one's level of morality. Implications for the research and practice of IS security are discussed.},

Although most organizations have long been using security technologies, it is well known that technology tools alone are not sufficient. Thus, the area of end-user security behaviors in organizations has gained an increased attention. In information security observing end-user security behaviors is challenging. Moreover, recent studies have shown that the end users have divergent security views. The inability to monitor employee IT security behaviors and divergent views regarding security policies, in our view, provide a setting where the principal agent paradigm applies. In this paper, we develop and test a theoretical model of the incentive effects of penalties, pressures and perceived effectiveness of employee actions that enhances our understanding of employee compliance to information security policies. Based on 312 employee responses from 77 organizations, we empirically validate and test the model. Our findings suggest that security behaviors can be influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. Pressures exerted by subjective norms and peer behaviors influence employee information security behaviors. Intrinsic motivation of employee perceived effectiveness of their actions was also found to play an important role in security policy compliance intentions. In analyzing the penalties, certainty of detection was found to be significant while surprisingly, severity of punishment was found to have a negative effect on security behavior intentions. We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and practice.},

abstract = {In recent years, rapid progress in the use of the internet has resulted in huge losses in many organizations due to lax security. As a result, information security awareness is becoming an important issue to anyone using the Internet. To reduce losses, organizations have made information security awareness a top priority. The three main barriers to information security awareness are: (1) general security awareness, (2) employees' computer skills, and (3) organizational budgets. Online learning appears a feasible alternative to providing information security awareness and countering these three barriers. Research has identified three levels of security awareness: perception, comprehension and projection. This paper reports on a laboratory experiment that investigates the impacts of hypermedia, multimedia and hypertext to increase information security awareness among the three awareness levels in an online training environment. The results indicate that: (1) learners who have the better understanding at the perception and comprehension levels can improve understanding at the projection level; (2) learners with text material perform better at the perception level; and (3) learners with multimedia material perform better at the comprehension level and projection level. The results could be used by educators and training designers to create meaningful information security awareness materials.},

After the questionnaires are collected, SEM is used to analyze the data. The analysis shows that the proposed factors positively influence users' intention to use a healthcare system. Information, service and system quality influence user's intention through the mediating constructs, perceived usefulness and perceived ease-of-use. Managerial implications are provided accordingly. Suggestions for introducing healthcare information system are then provided as well.},

This paper describes preparatory groundwork for the development of a prac-tical holistic model to help key stakeholders (inspectors, chemical companies) understand how human factors, safety man-agement systems and wider organisational issues fit together. The process was to break down the three areas into simpler components (taxonomy) and to use these smaller components as building blocks in an integrated reconstruction. To guide the reconstruction for the major hazard context, the taxonomy was used to analyse a small sample of major chemical acci-dents. The results were used to look for logical patterns of associations which could form a basis from which to develop further guiding principles of integration. The idea is that, once identified, the patterns can be used in the applied contexts of inspection and auditing. If the patterns can be found in practice they can be used to identify weaknesses that could initiate major accidents. Similarly, the patterns can be used to understand accident causation during accident investigations. The paper describes the key concepts and the development process.

@article{Roehrs2017,
abstract = {Background: Information and communication technology (ICT) has transformed the health care field worldwide. One of the main drivers of this change is the electronic health record (EHR). However, there are still open issues and challenges because the EHR usually reflects the partial view of a health care provider without the ability for patients to control or interact with their data. Furthermore, with the growth of mobile and ubiquitous computing, the number of records regarding personal health is increasing exponentially. This movement has been characterized as the Internet of Things (IoT), including the widespread development of wearable computing technology and assorted types of health-related sensors. This leads to the need for an integrated method of storing health-related data, defined as the personal health record (PHR), which could be used by health care providers and patients. This approach could combine EHRs with data gathered from sensors or other wearable computing devices. This unified view of patients' health could be shared with providers, who may not only use previous health-related records but also expand them with data resulting from their interactions. Another PHR advantage is that patients can interact with their health data, making decisions that may positively affect their health. Objective: This work aimed to explore the recent literature related to PHRs by defining the taxonomy and identifying challenges and open questions. In addition, this study specifically sought to identify data types, standards, profiles, goals, methods, functions, and architecture with regard to PHRs. Methods: The method to achieve these objectives consists of using the systematic literature review approach, which is guided by research questions using the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and context (PICOC) criteria. Results: As a result, we reviewed more than 5000 scientific studies published in the last 10 years, selected the most significant approaches, and thoroughly surveyed the health care field related to PHRs. We developed an updated taxonomy and identified challenges, open questions, and current data types, related standards, main profiles, input strategies, goals, functions, and architectures of the PHR. Conclusions: All of these results contribute to the achievement of a significant degree of coverage regarding the technology related to PHRs.},

First, behaviour can be simulated by activating motor structures, as during an overt action but suppressing its execution. Second, perception can be simulated by internal activation of sensory cortex, as during normal perception of external stimuli. Third, both overt and covert actions can elicit perceptual simulation of their normal consequences. A large body of evidence supports these assumptions. It is argued that the simulation approach can explain the relations between motor, sensory and cognitive functions and the appearance of an inner world.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES
This literature review identifies and categorises, from an organisational management perspective, barriers to the use of HIT or ICT for health. Based on the review, it offers policy interventions. 

METHODS
This systematic literature review was carried out during December 2009 and January 2010. Additional on-going reviews of updates through automated system alerts took place up until this paper was submitted. A total of thirty-one sources were searched including nine software platforms/databases, fifteen specialised websites/targeted databases, Google Scholar, ISI Science Citation Index and five journals hand-searched. 

RESULTS
The study covers seventy-nine articles on organisational barriers to ICT adoption by healthcare professionals. These are categorised under five main headings – (I) Structure of healthcare organisations; (II) Tasks; (III) People policies; (IV) Incentives; and (V) Information and decision processes. A total of ten subcategories are also identified. By adopting an organisational management approach, some recommendations to remove organisational management barriers are made. 

CONCLUSIONS
Despite their apparent promise, health information technologies (HIT) have proved difficult to implement. This systematic review reveals the implementation barriers associated to organisational management and their interrelations. Several important future directions in the field are also suggested: (1) there is a need for further research providing evidence of HIT cost-effectiveness as well as the development of optimal HIT applications; (2) more information is needed regarding organisational change, incentives, liability issues, end-users HIT competences and skills, structure and work process issues involved in realising the benefits from HIT. Future policy interventions should consider the five dimensions identified when addressing the impact of HIT in healthcare organisational systems, and how the impact of an intervention aimed at a particular dimension would interrelate with others.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. To date , many important threads of information privacy research have developed, but these threads have not been woven together into a cohesive fabric. This paper provides an interdisciplinary review of privacy-related research in order to enable a more cohesive treatment. With a sample of 320 privacy articles and 128 books and book sections, we classify previous literature in two ways: (1) using an ethics-based nomenclature of normative, purely descriptive, and empirically descriptive, and (2) based on their level of analysis : individual, group, organizational, and societal. Based upon our analyses via these two classification approaches, we identify three major areas in which previous research contributions reside : the conceptualization of information privacy, the relationship between information privacy and other constructs, and the contextual nature of these relationships. As we consider these major areas, we draw three overarching conclusions. First, there are many theoretical developments in the body of normative and purely descriptive studies that have not been addressed in empirical research on privacy. Rigorous studies that either trace processes associated with, or test implied assertions from, these value-laden arguments could add great value. Second, some of the levels of analysis have received less attention in certain contexts than have others in the research to date. Future empirical studies -both positivist and interpretive -could profitably be targeted to these under-researched levels of analysis. Third, positivist empirical studies will add the greatest value if they focus on antecedents to privacy concerns and on actual outcomes. In that light, we recommend that researchers be alert to an overarching macro model that we term APCO (Antecedents Privacy Concerns -{\textgreater} Outcomes).},

abstract = {I ntentional insider misuse of information systems resources (i.e., IS misuse) represents a significant threat to organizations. For example, industry statistics suggest that between 50{\%}–75{\%} of security incidents originate from within an organization. Because of the large number of misuse incidents, it has become important to understand how to reduce such behavior. General deterrence theory suggests that certain controls can serve as deterrent mechanisms by increasing the perceived threat of punishment for IS misuse. This paper presents an extended deterrence theory model that combines work from criminology, social psychology, and information systems. The model posits that user awareness of security countermeasures directly influences the perceived certainty and severity of organizational sanctions associated with IS misuse, which leads to reduced IS misuse intention. The model is then tested on 269 computer users from eight different companies. The results suggest that three practices deter IS misuse: user awareness of security policies; security education, training, and aware-ness (SETA) programs; and computer monitoring. The results also suggest that perceived severity of sanctions is more effective in reducing IS misuse than certainty of sanctions. Further, there is evidence that the impact of sanction perceptions vary based on one's level of morality. Implications for the research and practice of IS security are discussed.},

However, in spite of the anticipated value potential of this technology, there is widespread con cern that consumer privacy issues may impede its diffusion. In this study, we pose the question: Can individuals be per suaded to change their attitudes and opt-in behavioral inten tions toward EHRs, and allow their medical information to be digitized even in the presence of significant privacy concerns? To investigate this question, we integrate an individual's concern for information privacy (CFIP) with the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) to examine attitude change and likelihood of opting-in to an EHR system. We theorize that issue involvement and argument framing interact to influence attitude change, and that concern for information privacy further moderates the effects of these variables. We also propose that likelihood of adoption is driven by concern for information privacy and attitude. We test our predictions using an experiment with 366 subjects where we manipulate the framing of the arguments supporting EHRs. We find that an individual's CFIP interacts with argument framing and issue involvement to affect attitudes toward the use of EHRs. In addition, results suggest that attitude toward EHR use and CFIP directly influence opt-in behavioral intentions. An important finding for both theory and practice is that even when people have high concerns for privacy, their attitudes can be positively altered with appropriate message framing. These results as well as other theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

abstract = {Privacy policy statements and privacy assurance cues are among the most important website features that online providers use to increase individuals' trust and willingness to disclose private information online. The focus of this study is a comprehensive examination of the process by which privacy assurance mechan-isms influence trust and the moderating role of privacy concern in this process. We use the lens of the Elaboration Likelihood Model to investigate the way different individuals perceive and process privacy assurance mechanisms. We argue that the trust-enhancing role of these mechanisms depends on the individual's privacy concern. The results of this study articulate the process by which various privacy assurance mechanisms operate in enhancing an indivi-dual's trust, and show that there are distinct behavioral differences between individuals with high-vs low-privacy concern when forming their trust to disclose private information. The paper sheds new light on the role of elabora-tion in the trust building process, and shows why privacy assurance mechanisms have different impacts depending on individuals' privacy concerns.},

However, recent concerns about identify theft, confidentiality, and patient privacy have led to increasingly restrictive policies on data access, often preventing researchers from using these valuable data. We believe that these restrictions, and the research impeded or precluded by their implementation and enforcement, have had a significant negative impact on important public health research. Members of the public health community should challenge these policies through their professional societies and by lobbying legislators and health officials to advocate for changes that establish a more appropriate balance between privacy concerns and the protection of public health.},

Centralized electronic health records accumulate medical data of patients to improve their availability and complete-ness; EHRs are not tied to a single medical institution anymore. Nowadays enterprises with the capacity and knowledge to maintain this kind of databases offer the services of main-taining EHRs and adding personal health data by the patients. These enterprises get access on the patients' medical data and act as a main point for collecting and disclosing personal data to third parties, e.g. among others doctors, healthcare service providers and drug stores. Existing systems like Microsoft HealthVault and Google Health comply with data protection acts by letting the patients decide on the usage and disclosure of their data. But they fail in satisfying essential requirements to privacy. We propose a privacy-protecting information system for controlled disclosure of personal data to third parties. Firstly, patients should be able to express and enforce obligations regarding a disclosure of health data to third parties. Secondly, an organization providing EHRs should neither be able to gain access to these health data nor establish a profile about patients.},

abstract = {Background: Information and communication technology (ICT) has transformed the health care field worldwide. One of the main drivers of this change is the electronic health record (EHR). However, there are still open issues and challenges because the EHR usually reflects the partial view of a health care provider without the ability for patients to control or interact with their data. Furthermore, with the growth of mobile and ubiquitous computing, the number of records regarding personal health is increasing exponentially. This movement has been characterized as the Internet of Things (IoT), including the widespread development of wearable computing technology and assorted types of health-related sensors. This leads to the need for an integrated method of storing health-related data, defined as the personal health record (PHR), which could be used by health care providers and patients. This approach could combine EHRs with data gathered from sensors or other wearable computing devices. This unified view of patients' health could be shared with providers, who may not only use previous health-related records but also expand them with data resulting from their interactions. Another PHR advantage is that patients can interact with their health data, making decisions that may positively affect their health. Objective: This work aimed to explore the recent literature related to PHRs by defining the taxonomy and identifying challenges and open questions. In addition, this study specifically sought to identify data types, standards, profiles, goals, methods, functions, and architecture with regard to PHRs. Methods: The method to achieve these objectives consists of using the systematic literature review approach, which is guided by research questions using the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and context (PICOC) criteria. Results: As a result, we reviewed more than 5000 scientific studies published in the last 10 years, selected the most significant approaches, and thoroughly surveyed the health care field related to PHRs. We developed an updated taxonomy and identified challenges, open questions, and current data types, related standards, main profiles, input strategies, goals, functions, and architectures of the PHR. Conclusions: All of these results contribute to the achievement of a significant degree of coverage regarding the technology related to PHRs.},

Nevertheless, health care data usually contains a lot of patient privacy. Sharing that data directly would bring huge threaten to patient privacy. It's necessary to develop practical methods to balance health care data sharing and privacy protection. Although many approaches have been developed to deal with these problems, most of them are focusing on a small scope of the problem with single theory. In this paper, we'd like to introduce a framework for privacy preserving data sharing with the view of practical application in more comprehensive way. The framework focuses on three key problems of privacy protection during data sharing which are privacy definition and detection, privacy protection policy management, privacy preserving health care data sharing. And solutions to these three problems are discussed in details. A simple implementation of the framework would be introduced to solve the problems of privacy-preserving electronic medical records publishing.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. (1) Background, Motivation and Objective: Academic study of Cloud Computing within Saudi Arabia is an emerging research field. Saudi Arabia represents the largest economy in the Arabian Gulf region. This positions it as a potential market of cloud computing technologies. Adoption of new innovations should be preceded by analysis of the added value, challenges and adequacy from technological, organizational and environmental perspectives. (2) Statement of Contribution/Method: This cross-sectional exploratory empirical research is based on Technology, Organization and Environment model targeting higher education institutions. In this study, the factors that influence the adoption by higher education institutions were analyzed and tested using Partial Least Square. (3) Results, Discussion and Conclusions: Three factors were found significant in this context. Relative Advantage, Data Privacy and Complexity are the most significant factors. The model explained 43{\%} of the total adoption measure variation. Significant differences in the areas of cloud computing compatibility, complexity, vendor lock-in and peer pressure between large and small institutions were revealed. Items for future cloud computing research were explored through open-ended questions. Adoption of cloud services by higher education institutions has been started. It was found that the adoption rate among large universities is higher than small higher education institutions. Improving the network and Internet Infrastructure in Saudi Arabia at an affordable cost is a pre-requisite for cloud computing adoption. Cloud service provider should address the privacy and complexity concerns raised by non-adopters. Future information systems that are potential for hosting in cloud were prioritized.},

abstract = {With the significant advances in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) over the last half century, there is an increasingly perceived vision that computing will one day be the 5th utility (after water, electricity, gas, and telephony). This computing utility, like all other four existing utilities, will provide the basic level of computing service that is considered essential to meet the everyday needs of the general community. To deliver this vision, a number of computing paradigms have been proposed, of which the latest one is known as Cloud computing. Hence, in this paper, we define Cloud computing and provide the architecture for creating Clouds with market-oriented resource allocation by leveraging technologies such as Virtual Machines (VMs). We also provide insights on market-based resource management strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management and computational risk management to sustain Service Level Agreement (SLA)-oriented resource allocation. In addition, we reveal our early thoughts on interconnecting Clouds for dynamically creating global Cloud exchanges and markets. Then, we present some representative Cloud platforms, especially those developed in industries, along with our current work towards realizing market-oriented resource allocation of Clouds as realized in Aneka enterprise Cloud technology. Furthermore, we highlight the difference between High Performance Computing (HPC) workload and Internet-based services workload. We also describe a meta-negotiation infrastructure to establish global Cloud exchanges and markets, and illustrate a case study of harnessing 'Storage Clouds' for high performance content delivery. Finally, we conclude with the need for convergence of competing IT paradigms to deliver our 21st century vision.},

abstract = {Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) constitute a powerful mechanism for sharing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) across organizational boundaries in healthcare systems. The electronic sphere of patient data is growing but some patients and medical providers remain hesitant to adopt networked information tech-nology due to privacy and security concerns. The U.S. Government has recognized the importance of safeguarding and preserving the privacy of patient data in HIEs, establishing and endorsing privacy standards and information sharing guidelines. This chapter explores the issues and principles shaping HIE privacy solutions, and discusses emerging trends that will influence the design and implementation of privacy-preserving technologies for HIEs. 12.1 Introduction The potential benefits of Health Information Exchanges (HIEs) are well understood, and have been described by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in recent publications [59, 64]. Through streamlined information sharing and interoperable workflow processes across healthcare systems, HIEs enable clinicians to deliver a higher quality of care with greater safety for patients [53]. They can help clinicians reduce medical errors and avoid redundant testing. Along the way, HIEs yield new efficiencies and better clinician access to medical diagnostic tools and clinical decision support systems. They serve as a vehicle for public and community health reporting and monitoring, and offer a valuable link between research and clinical practice.},

With the newly enacted Directive 2011/24/EU on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare due for implementation by 2013, it is inevitable that a centralised European health record system will become a reality even before 2020. However, the concept of a centralised supranational central server raises concern about storing electronic medical records in a central location. The privacy threat posed by a supranational network is a key concern. Cross-border and Interoperable electronic health record systems make confidential data more easily and rapidly accessible to a wider audience and increase the risk that personal data concerning health could be accidentally exposed or easily distributed to unauthorised parties by enabling greater access to a compilation of the personal data concerning health, from different sources, and throughout a lifetime.},

Maintaining protection and privacy of personal information is a strong motivation in the development of security policies. It is critical for health care organizations to access, analyze, and ensure security policies to meet the challenge and to develop the necessary policies to ensure the security of medical information. The problem, then, is how we can maintain the availability of the electronic medical records and at the same time maintain the privacy of patients' information. This paper will propose a novel architecture model for the Electronic Medical Record (EMR), in which useful statistical medical records will be available to the interested parties while maintaining the privacy of patients' information.},

Method: Standards, guidelines and recommendations on security and privacy best practices for staff personnel were identified using a systematic literature review. After a revision pro-cess, a questionnaire consisting of 27 questions was created and responded to by 180 health professionals from a public hospital. Results: Weak passwords were reported by 62.2{\%} of the respondents, 31.7{\%} were unaware of the organization's procedures for discarding confidential information, and 19.4{\%} did not carry out these procedures. Half of the respondents (51.7{\%}) did not take measures to ensure that the personal health information on the computer monitor could not be seen by unau-thorized individuals, and 57.8{\%} were unaware of the procedure established to report a security violation. The correlation between the number of years in the position and good security practices was not significant (Pearson's r = 0.085, P = 0.254). Age was weakly cor-related with good security practices (Pearson's r = −0.169, P = 0.028). A Mann–Whitney test showed no significant difference between the respondents' security behavior as regards gender (U = 2536, P = 0.792, n = 178). The results of the study suggest that more efforts are required to improve security education for health personnel. Conclusions: It was found that both preventive and corrective actions are needed to prevent health staff from causing security incidents. Healthcare organizations should: identify the types of information that require protection, clearly communicate the penalties that will be imposed, promote security training courses, and define what the organization considers improper behavior to be and communicate this to all personnel.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: eHealth is an application of information and communication technologies across the whole range of functions that affect health. The benefits of eHealth (eg, improvement of health care operational efficiency and quality of patient care) have previously been documented in the literature. Health care providers (eg, medical doctors) are the key driving force in pushing eHealth initiatives. Without their acceptance and actual use, those eHealth benefits would be unlikely to be reaped. OBJECTIVE: To identify and synthesize influential factors to health care providers' acceptance of various eHealth systems. METHODS: This systematic literature review was conducted in four steps. The first two steps facilitated the location and identification of relevant articles. The third step extracted key information from those articles including the studies' characteristics and results. In the last step, identified factors were analyzed and grouped in accordance with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). RESULTS: This study included 93 papers that have studied health care providers' acceptance of eHealth. From these papers, 40 factors were identified and grouped into 7 clusters: (1) health care provider characteristics, (2) medical practice characteristics, (3) voluntariness of use, (4) performance expectancy, (5) effort expectancy, (6) social influence, and (7) facilitating or inhibiting conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The grouping results demonstrated that the UTAUT model is useful for organizing the literature but has its limitations. Due to the complex contextual dynamics of health care settings, our work suggested that there would be potential to extend theories on information technology adoption, which is of great benefit to readers interested in learning more on the topic. Practically, these findings may help health care decision makers proactively introduce interventions to encourage acceptance of eHealth and may also assist health policy makers refine relevant policies to promote the eHealth innovation.},

abstract = {Abstract One of the most vulnerable stakeholders that may violate health information privacy prescribed in {\{}HIPAA{\}} (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) are nursing students who have some limited access to {\{}EMR{\}} systems to retrieve health records while freely communicating with patients and relevant stakeholders. However, limited attention has been given to nursing students' deviant behaviors. To fill this gap, this study develops a research model of a nursing student's behavior of disclosing health information by identifying the deterrent effects of health information security awareness (HISA) nurtured by nursing schools and personal values such as personal norms and self-control. Our study empirically tests the model and found that three learning components ((1) general information security awareness, (2) health information security regulation awareness, and (3) punishment severity awareness) are significantly important to develop HISA. We find that {\{}HISA{\}} significantly affects personal norms and self-control which play as deterrence against the intention to disclose patients' health information. As the importance of complying with {\{}HIPAA{\}} regulations and information security policies by employees who work in health care industry increases, our findings shed new light on the role of {\{}HISA{\}} and personal values in nursing education and the health care industry's efforts to protect patients' health information. },

abstract = {Healthcare in the digital age is undergoing an IT revolution. In the US, spurred by legislation such as the Health Information Technology and Economics Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, electronic health records (EHR) adoption has dramatically increased. Meanwhile, enabled by mobile devices and ubiquitous networks, patients and physicians interact with health information in novel ways. Given health information's sensitive nature, however, a cautious approach to IT integration is warranted to ensure that patients' sensitive information is protected. Although health information security is of great interest in both academia and practice, relatively little scholarship has examined the security implications of the behavior of those who actually use IT in the healthcare sector. To stimulate this important discussion, the authors briefly describe the changing landscape of an IT-enabled healthcare ecosystem and discuss the emerging issues of mobility and security. This article is part of a special issue on IT security.},

In this survey, we categorize and evaluate state-of-the-art electronic health system research based on their architecture, as well as services including access control, emergency access, sharing, searching, and anonymity methods by considering their cryptographic approaches. Our survey differs from previous EHS related surveys in being method-based such that the proposed services are classified based on their methods and compared with other solutions. We provide performance comparisons and state commonly used methods for each category. We also identify relevant open problems and provide future research directions.},

abstract = {The adoption of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) in healthcare organizations has numerous benefits to physicians, patients, and healthcare services. However, unresolved security and privacy concerns pertaining to patient information cause relatively low adoption of EMR by health institutions. Safeguarding large amount of sensitive health data at different locations and forms proves to be a major challenge of EMR. In this paper, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is presented to (1) identify the security and privacy concerns in the adoption of EMR by health organizations and (2) to analyze the existing solutions in addressing the identified concerns. A total of 393 papers were found in this regard. After careful study and the removal of duplicate papers and screening of studies, 15 papers which met the inclusion criteria were selected for the review. This review will help researchers to be aware of the privacy and security concerns of EMR and the existing solutions. The review revealed that the security and privacy issues related to EMR are inadequately addressed. This study indicates that the technical and financial supports are insufficient to overcome the security issues of EMR, and thus, the success factors and security culture should be investigated. Developing countries meet many challenges in adopting EMR, especially due to the lack of security policy and background infrastructure. Hence, novel solutions such as best practice guidelines with respect to security and privacy are necessary to aid successfully adoption EMR.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: eHealth is an application of information and communication technologies across the whole range of functions that affect health. The benefits of eHealth (eg, improvement of health care operational efficiency and quality of patient care) have previously been documented in the literature. Health care providers (eg, medical doctors) are the key driving force in pushing eHealth initiatives. Without their acceptance and actual use, those eHealth benefits would be unlikely to be reaped. OBJECTIVE: To identify and synthesize influential factors to health care providers' acceptance of various eHealth systems. METHODS: This systematic literature review was conducted in four steps. The first two steps facilitated the location and identification of relevant articles. The third step extracted key information from those articles including the studies' characteristics and results. In the last step, identified factors were analyzed and grouped in accordance with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). RESULTS: This study included 93 papers that have studied health care providers' acceptance of eHealth. From these papers, 40 factors were identified and grouped into 7 clusters: (1) health care provider characteristics, (2) medical practice characteristics, (3) voluntariness of use, (4) performance expectancy, (5) effort expectancy, (6) social influence, and (7) facilitating or inhibiting conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The grouping results demonstrated that the UTAUT model is useful for organizing the literature but has its limitations. Due to the complex contextual dynamics of health care settings, our work suggested that there would be potential to extend theories on information technology adoption, which is of great benefit to readers interested in learning more on the topic. Practically, these findings may help health care decision makers proactively introduce interventions to encourage acceptance of eHealth and may also assist health policy makers refine relevant policies to promote the eHealth innovation.},

abstract = {Objectives: Healthcare organizations have been digitizing their Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) for several years now and one of the primary concerns of their widespread implementation is the assurance of privacy for the sensitive information [22,23]. The objective of this study is to shed light into healthcare providers' attitudes towards privacy with regards to EMRs. We argue that healthcare providers place a priority on privacy issues given regulatory, fiscal, and reputation repercussions. Methods: Using Information Boundary Theory [41] as a theoretical framework, we established four research questions. These questions formed the basis for the hypotheses that healthcare providers would agree with withholding information (to prevent loss and increase gains) as well as disagree with sharing information. We constructed a survey from this framework and administered it to 327 subjects (with a 45{\%} response rate). Survey validation was conducted as well as hypothesis testing. Results: The analysis of the data yielded a result that indicated that the survey responses did not support the hypotheses. Healthcare providers strongly disagreed that they would withhold information to solidify gains or mitigate losses. The subjects also agreed that they would share information in order to solidify gains or mitigate losses. Conclusions: This led to the surprising conclusion that healthcare providers do not place privacy as a high-priority within the context of their duties. Healthcare professionals prioritize personal and organizational gain as well as mitigating personal and organizational loss over privacy of EMRs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although policy discourses frame integrated Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as essential for contemporary healthcare systems, increased information sharing often raises concerns among patients and the public. This paper examines patient and public views about the security and privacy of EHRs used for health provision, research and policy in the UK.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Sequential mixed methods study with a cross-sectional survey (in 2011) followed by focus group discussions (in 2012-2013). Survey participants (N = 5331) were recruited from primary and secondary care settings in West London (UK). Complete data for 2761 (51.8 {\%}) participants were included in the final analysis for this paper. The survey results were discussed in 13 focus groups with people living with a range of different health conditions, and in 4 mixed focus groups with patients, health professionals and researchers (total N = 120). Qualitative data were analysed thematically.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In the survey, 79 {\%} of participants reported that they would worry about the security of their record if this was part of a national EHR system and 71 {\%} thought the National Health Service (NHS) was unable to guarantee EHR safety at the time this work was carried out. Almost half (47 {\%}) responded that EHRs would be less secure compared with the way their health record was held at the time of the survey. Of those who reported being worried about EHR security, many would nevertheless support their development (55 {\%}), while 12 {\%} would not support national EHRs and a sizeable proportion (33 {\%}) were undecided. There were also variations by age, ethnicity and education. In focus group discussions participants weighed up perceived benefits against potential security and privacy threats from wider sharing of information, as well as discussing other perceived risks: commercial exploitation, lack of accountability, data inaccuracies, prejudice and inequalities in health provision.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Patient and public worries about the security risks associated with integrated EHRs highlight the need for intensive public awareness and engagement initiatives, together with the establishment of trustworthy security and privacy mechanisms for health information sharing.},

In the proposed framework, pri-vacy protection, access control, and secure transmission mod-ules are designed to enhance the privacy protection of a HIS. An experimental privacy-enhanced HIS is also implemented. Furthermore, we proposed a research model extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology by consid-ering perceived security and information security literacy and then investigate user adoption of a privacy-enhanced HIS. The experimental results and analyses showed that user adoption of a privacy-enhanced HIS is directly affected by social influence, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and perceived security. Perceived security has a mediating effect between information security literacy and user adoption. This study proposes several implications for research and practice to improve designing, development, and promotion of a good healthcare information system with privacy protection.},

abstract = {Many people in the US healthcare industry, our government, and the press use the terms electronic medical record (EMR) and electronic health record (EHR) interchangeably. However, these terms describe completely different concepts, both of which are crucial to the success of local, regional, and national goals to improve patient safety, improve the quality and efficiency of patient care, and reduce healthcare delivery costs. EHRs are reliant on EMRs being in place, and EMRs will never reach their full potential without interoperable EHRs in place. It s important to understand the differences, and to reduce confusion in the market. The EMR is the legal record created in hospitals and ambulatory environments that is the source of data for the EHR. The EHR represents the ability to easily share medical information among stakeholders and to have a patient s information follow him or her through the various modalities of care engaged by that individual. Stakeholders are composed of patients/consumers, healthcare providers, employers, and/or payers/insurers, including the government. But before we can move to effective EHR environments, provider organizations must implement complete EMR solutions. At this point, few hospitals have EMR solutions that can effectively reduce medical errors or improve the quality and efficiency of patient care. The Clinical Transformation Staging Model has been developed by HIMSS Analytics to assess the status of clinical system/EMR implementations in care delivery organizations. This model demonstrates that US hospitals have a long journey ahead of them to achieve the EHR visions being espoused in Washington, D.C. and in the 200+ neo-CHIN Regional Health Information Organization (RHIO) initiatives in various states of development across the country.},

abstract = {a r t i c l e i n f o a b s t r a c t With the rapid development of information systems and advances in healthcare technology paired with current concerns arise over patients' safety and how to cure them efficiently, the healthcare information systems are attracting the attention of more and more people. The purpose of this study is to propose a conceptual model, appropriate for the intention to use healthcare information systems, by adopting the system, service, and information qualities covered in the Information System Success Model proposed by DeLone and Mclean [1] as the external variables and integrating the three dimensions of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and intention to use — referred to in Venkatesh and Davis' updated Technology Acceptance Model, TAM [2]. This study first analyzes relevant researches on the intention to use such systems as the basis for the questionnaire design, then conducts questionnaire survey among district hospital nurses, head directors, and other related personnel. After the questionnaires are collected, SEM is used to analyze the data. The analysis shows that the proposed factors positively influence users' intention to use a healthcare system. Information, service and system quality influence user's intention through the mediating constructs, perceived usefulness and perceived ease-of-use. Managerial implications are provided accordingly. Suggestions for introducing healthcare information system are then provided as well.},

abstract = {Background: There is a need to ensure that the growing number of consumer health information technologies designed to support patient engagement account for the larger social context in which health is managed. Basic research on how patients engage this larger social context is needed as a precursor to the development of patient-centered consumer health information technology (IT) solutions. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to inform the broader design of consumer health IT by characterizing patients' existing health information communication practices with their social network members. Methods: This qualitative study took place between 2010 and 2012 in a Midwestern city. Eighteen patients with chronic conditions participated in a semi-structured interview that was analyzed using qualitative content analysis and descriptive statistics. Emphasis was placed on recruiting a sample representing diverse cultural groups and including participants of low socioeconomic status. Results: Participants' social networks included a wide range of individuals, spanning biological relatives, divinities, and second-degree relationships. Participants' rationales for health information communication reflected seven themes: (1) characteristics and circumstances of the person, (2) characteristics and circumstances of the relationship, (3) structure and composition of the social network, (4) content of the message, (5) orientation of the goal, (6) dimensions of the context, and (7) adaptive practices. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that patients' health information communication practices are multidimensional, engaging individuals beyond formal and informal caregivers and driven by characteristics of their personal lives and larger social contexts in addition to their health problem. New models of consumer health IT must be created to better align with the realities of patients' communication routines.},

abstract = {Objective: To report the results of a systematic literature review concerning the security and privacy of electronic health record (EHR) systems. Data sources: Original articles written in English found in MEDLINE, ACM Digital Library, Wiley InterScience, IEEE Digital Library, Science@Direct, MetaPress, ERIC, CINAHL and Trip Database. Study selection: Only those articles dealing with the security and privacy of EHR systems. Data extraction: The extraction of 775 articles using a predefined search string, the outcome of which was reviewed by three authors and checked by a fourth. Results: A total of 49 articles were selected, of which 26 used standards or regulations related to the privacy and security of EHR data. The most widely used regulations are the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. We found 23 articles that used symmetric key and/or asymmetric key schemes and 13 articles that employed the pseudo anonymity technique in EHR systems. A total of 11 articles propose the use of a digital signature scheme based on PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and 13 articles propose a login/password (seven of them combined with a digital certificate or PIN) for authentication. The preferred access control model appears to be Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), since it is used in 27 studies. Ten of these studies discuss who should define the EHR systems' roles. Eleven studies discuss who should provide access to EHR data: patients or health entities. Sixteen of the articles reviewed indicate that it is necessary to override defined access policies in the case of an emergency. In 25 articles an audit-log of the system is produced. Only four studies mention that system users and/or health staff should be trained in security and privacy. Conclusions: Recent years have witnessed the design of standards and the promulgation of directives concerning security and privacy in EHR systems. However, more work should be done to adopt these regulations and to deploy secure EHR systems. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Critical to OCTAVE{\textregistered} are the tools and processes toward developing asset- based threat profiles. The threat profile includes network risks, also known as vulnerabilities that often times analysis team members are not qualified to assess. Vulnerability assessment tools aid the OCTAVE{\textregistered} analysis team to determine exactly what network-aware technological risks face any certain asset and often times help to further define the asset itself.

In principle there are no reasons for considering it not applicable to the health care sector.

abstract = {he 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda integrate all three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, social and environmental) recognizing that eradicating poverty and inequality, creating inclusive economic growth and preserving the planet are inextricably linked. Health is centrally positioned within the 2030 Agenda, with one comprehensive goal (SDG 3) and its 13 targets covering all major health priorities, and links to targets in many of the other goals. The 2030 Agenda has major implications for health monitoring. Monitoring will need to reflect the fact that the SDGs are relevant for all countries. In order to accommodate a much broader range of health and health-related issues, country, regional and global monitoring systems will have to adapt. This will mean, at the very least, undertaking health data collection, analysis and communication in an integrated manner. The SDG focus on leaving no one behind means that much greater attention will have to be given to disaggregated data. Health monitoring will have to look beyond the health sector and consider economic, social and environmental indicators, as well as intersectoral actions. The 2030 Agenda also puts strong emphasis on country follow-up and review processes as the basis for accountability. Strengthening country health information systems should therefore be a priority. This report brings together the most recent data on the proposed health and selected health-related SDG indicators – to assess the current situation and describe crucial data gaps. In the current absence of official goal-level indicators, summary measures of health such as (healthy) life expectancy are used to provide a general assessment of the situation. As universal health coverage (UHC) is a central concern, statistics are presented on a service-coverage index and on measures of financial protection using the WHO/World Bank UHC monitoring framework. In relation to equity, special attention is given to describing the statistical situation disaggregated by key demographic, geographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Because the 2030 Agenda emphasizes the interlinked nature of all the various goals, this report also includes indicators of selected health determinants and risk factors in relation to other SDG targets. More work is required to fully integrate monitoring the health dimension in other goals. Available data show that in spite of the major progress during the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) era, major challenges remain in terms of reducing maternal and child mortality, improving nutrition, and achieving further progress in the battle against infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, neglected tropical diseases and hepatitis. The situation analysis also provides evidence of the importance of addressing noncommunicable diseases and their risk factors such as tobacco use, mental health problems, road traffic injuries, and environmental health issues. Data on water and sanitation and air quality show that much more needs to be done to reduce risks to health. Weak health systems are a major obstacle in many countries, resulting in major deficiencies in UHC for even the most basic health services and inadequate preparedness for health emergencies. This report shows that for most SDG health and health-related targets it is possible to provide an overview of the global situation and trends using a limited number of indicators. It, however, also shows that there are major data gaps for many indicators. For instance, several health and health-related indicators require regular, quality data on mortality by age, sex and cause of death, which are still lacking in most countries. The demand for comparable disaggregated statistics is particularly challenging for almost all indicators. These deficiencies will require major investments in strengthening country health information and statistical systems. MONITORING},

abstract = {WHO inputs to the 2016 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development on " Ensuring that no one is left behind " May 2016 Equity is at the heart of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In pledging to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), countries have committed to leave no one behind. It is of particular importance that paragraph 26 of the 2030 Agenda states: " To promote physical and mental health and well-being, and to extend life expectancy for all, we must achieve universal health coverage and access to quality health care. No one must be left behind " , thus highlighting the role of health sector in addressing the needs of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable. In addition, the SDG 3 focuses on ensuring healthy lives for all at all ages, positioning equity as a central issue in health, contributing to reducing inequality within and between countries to promote the inclusion and empowerment of all. " Leaving no one behind " requires identifying, understanding and addressing of health inequities between and within countries and between people themselves, wherever they live. It means looking deep into health sector, but also into all aspects of people's lives – conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live and age – as political, economic, social, environmental determinants which shape the conditions of daily lives. The work of the World Health Organization focusses on the needs of all peoples since its very beginning. The WHO Constitution itself is based on 9 principles which are as relevant today for the sustainable development agenda as they were almost 70 years ago. Throughout the intervening years, WHO and its Member States have consistently re-affirmed their commitment to improve health of all peoples, by adopting the Declaration of Alma-Ata in 1978, the Global Strategy for Health for All in 1981, through the Commission on Social Determinants of Health and its findings in 2008, to name but a few.},

abstract = {Industry reports indicate that the number of security incidents happened in healthcare organisation is increasing. Lessons learned (i.e. the causes of a security incident and the recommendations intended to avoid any recurrence) from those security incidents should ideally inform information security management systems (ISMS). The sharing of the lessons learned is an essential activity in the “follow-up” phase of security incident response lifecycle, which has long been addressed but not given enough attention in academic and industry.

This dissertation proposes a novel approach, the Generic Security Template (GST), aiming to feed back the lessons learned from real world security incidents to the ISMS. It adapts graphical Goal Structuring Notations (GSN), to present the lessons learned in a structured manner through mapping them to the security requirements of the ISMS. The suitability of the GST has been confirmed by demonstrating that instances of the GST can be produced from real world security incidents of different countries based on in-depth analysis of case studies.

The usability of the GST has been evaluated using a series of empirical studies. The GST is empirically evaluated in terms of its given effectiveness in assisting the communication of the lessons learned from security incidents as compared to the traditional text based approach alone. The results show that the GST can help to improve the accuracy and reduce the mental efforts in assisting the identification of the lessons learned from security incidents and the results are statistically significant. The GST is further evaluated to determine whether users can apply the GST to structure insights derived from a specific security incident. The results show that students with a computer science background can create an instance of the GST.

The acceptability of the GST is assessed in a healthcare organisation. Strengths and weaknesses are identified and the GST has been adjusted to fit into organisational needs. The GST is then further tested to examine its capability to feed back the security lessons to the ISMS. The results show that, by using the GST, lessons identified from security incidents from one healthcare organisation in a specific country can be transferred to another and can indeed inform the improvements of the ISMS.

In summary, the GST provides a unified way to feed back the lessons learned to the ISMS. It fosters an environment where different stakeholders can speak the same language while exchanging the lessons learned from the security incidents around the world.},

In this paper, a literature review is used to gain knowledge about the medical and information security cultures involved. The gap between the intention to use Information Technology and actual compliance is examined with an investigation of behavioural change agents as Information Technology-usage motivators. Research reveals emotions as strong motivators of attitudes and behaviours. The Coping Model of User Adaptation is reviewed together with the Appraisal Tendency Framework. Logical argumentation is used to propose a theory that uses a behavioural change agent with the Coping Model of User Adaptation and the Framework for Classifying Emotions (an off-shoot of the Appraisal Tendency Framework) as tools. This theory will promote emotions that are conducive to information security obedience (or ‘good' information security behaviour) in the healthcare context.},

abstract = {The adoption of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) in healthcare organizations has numerous benefits to physicians, patients, and healthcare services. However, unresolved security and privacy concerns pertaining to patient information cause relatively low adoption of EMR by health institutions. Safeguarding large amount of sensitive health data at different locations and forms proves to be a major challenge of EMR. In this paper, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is presented to (1) identify the security and privacy concerns in the adoption of EMR by health organizations and (2) to analyze the existing solutions in addressing the identified concerns. A total of 393 papers were found in this regard. After careful study and the removal of duplicate papers and screening of studies, 15 papers which met the inclusion criteria were selected for the review. This review will help researchers to be aware of the privacy and security concerns of EMR and the existing solutions. The review revealed that the security and privacy issues related to EMR are inadequately addressed. This study indicates that the technical and financial supports are insufficient to overcome the security issues of EMR, and thus, the success factors and security culture should be investigated. Developing countries meet many challenges in adopting EMR, especially due to the lack of security policy and background infrastructure. Hence, novel solutions such as best practice guidelines with respect to security and privacy are necessary to aid successfully adoption EMR.},

However, it is a requirement that is often difficult to address, particularly within small organisations, as a result of a lack of resources and expertise. This paper identifies the need for security awareness and describes the prototype implementation of a software tool that enables individuals to pursue self-paced security training. The tool provides an environment that permits the user to simulate the introduction of security into a number of pre-defined case study scenarios. This enables staff to become familiar with the types of countermeasures available, the situations in which they are appropriate and any constraints that they may impose. This would be particularly valuable in small organisations where specialist knowledge is often scarce and issues need to be addressed by existing staff.},

Companies and organizations have developed programs that seek to promote security and enhance users' perception of the importance of exercising security. As raising awareness, however, is an on-going effort, the campaign has to be regularly evaluated so that corrective actions can be taken in order to achieve the best results. This paper addresses the importance of evaluating an organization's awareness program and provides guidelines and a methodology that will help organizations assess their efforts. The proposed framework includes the evaluation of individual awareness-related processes via respective metrics as well as the aggregation of the aforementioned metrics to produce an overall evaluation score, usable both as a benchmark for future iterations of the evaluation program as well as a figure presentable to higher management.},

Abstract This paper examines user participation in information systems security risk management and its influence in the context of regulatory compliance via a multi-method study at the organizational level First, eleven informants across five organizations were interviewed to gain an understanding of the types of activities and security controls in which users participated as part of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, along with associated outcomes. A research model was developed based on the findings of the qualitative study and extant user participation theories in the systems development literature. Analysis of the data collected in a questionnaire survey of 228 members of IS AC A, a professional association specialized in Mikko Siponen was the accepting senior editor for this paper. Richard Baskerville served as the associate editor. The appendices for this paper are located in the "Online Supplements" section of the MS Quarterly's website (http://www.misq.org). information technology governance, audit, and security, supported the research model. Thefindings ofthe two studies converged and indicated that user participation contributed to improved security control performance through greater awareness, greater alignment between IS security risk management and the business environment, and improved control development. While the IS security literature often portrays users as the weak link in security, the current study suggests that users may be an important resource to IS security by providing needed business knowledge that contributes to more effective security measures. User participation is also a means to engage users in protecting sensitive information in their business processes.},

abstract = {Security threats caused by the inappropriate actions of the user continue to be a significant security problem within any organization. The purpose of this study was to continue the efforts of Katz by assessing the security behavior and practices of working professionals. Katz conducted a study that assessed whether the faculty and staff at Armstrong Atlantic State University had been performing the simple everyday practices and behavior necessary to avert insider threats to information security. Critical in understanding human behavior is in knowing how behavior varies across different groups or demographics. Because a user's behavior can be influenced by demographic groups, this study adapted Katz's study by examining the influence on the security behavior of four demographic groups identified by gender, age, education, and occupation. Like Katz, this study used a 5-point Likert scale quantitative self-administered, closed-ended questionnaire to assess the participants' security practices and behaviors. The questionnaire was developed in two sections: Section 1 used a binary scale to gather the participants' demographics data while Section 2 used a 5-point Likert scale to measure the participants' security behaviors. The sample population was derived from working professionals at the General Dynamic and Program Manager Advanced Amphibious Assault (GD {\&} PM AAA) Facility in Woodbridge, Virginia. The total population at PM AAA Office was 288, of which 87 or 30{\%} completed the survey. Results of the demographic survey indicate that (a) women were more security aware than their male counterparts, (b) younger participants were more security aware than their older counterparts, (c) participants who did not attend college were more security aware than their college-educated counterparts, and (d) participants in nontechnical positions were more security aware than their counterparts in technical positions. The results indicate that a relation exists between the participants' security behaviors and their levels of security awareness.},

abstract = {Researchers have explored the potential of using various approaches in order to reduce the number of security breaches caused by system users. The approaches can be categorized into technology and non-technology approaches. Technology approaches advocate the use of technological tools or integrating a variety of technologies during system design in order to address security issues. Non-technology approaches advocate the use of other means such as good user interface design and user education in order to reduce security breaches.                 The research described in this thesis considers non-technical approaches. It specifically evaluates system administrator and user perceptions of information security practices and user awareness at Florida State University. The study involves system administrators and end users. Data for this research was collected by surveying and interviewing system administrators; in addition, documents such as such security policies, training materials and email alerts were reviewed. End user data was collected by using a questionnaire.                 The aim of the system administrators' survey was to collect preliminary information about user awareness. Then follow up interviews were used to determine the perceptions of system administrators regarding non-technical approaches to security and their views about the user's role in security. Although interview results showed that system administrators placed more emphasis on external and technical threats than on internal and non-technical threats due to different factors including availability of resources, attitude toward users, and satisfaction with technological tools, in general results from system administrators showed that system administrators are more likely to engage effectively in user awareness if such barriers to user awareness are addressed.                 The second part of the study surveyed end users. The aim of the survey was to collect information about end users' general information vulnerability, awareness and practices. Findings from user surveys showed that users need user awareness education for them to be able to protect themselves against security attacks.                 The results of this study have increased understanding of the problems that hinder nontechnical approaches to security. The fact that user practices have been shown to correlate with security awareness suggests that it is time to consider human factors.},

This study has been carried out in an effort to investigate the IS users' risky behaviors that may threaten information security. The preventive actions employed by users, the threats they may be exposed to, or whether they had an adverse experience or to what extent they perceive risks have also been investigated. Four scales: Risky Behavior Scale (RBS), Conservative Behavior Scale (CBS), Exposure to Offence Scale (EOS) and Risk Perception Scale (RPS), were developed depending on the data collected with the use of surveys. The scales developed from the content of the survey were applied to students, academics and administrative staff of a university, which also embodies hospitals and educational organizations located in different geographical and socio-economical regions of Turkey. On the base of developed scales, the results of the study show that there are significant differences within samples and according to the habits of Internet usage.},

abstract = {Effective user security awareness campaign can greatly enhance the information assurance posture of an organization. Information security includes organizational aspects, legal aspects, institutionalization and applications of best practices in addition to security technologies. User awareness represents a significant challenge in the security domain, with the human factor ultimately being the element that is exploited in a variety of attack scenarios. Information security awareness program is a critical component in any organizations strategy. In contrast to other information security awareness work which mostly explains methods and techniques for raising information security awareness; this paper discusses and evaluates the effectiveness of different information security awareness tools and techniques on the basis of psychological theories and models. Finally, it describes how to measure information security awareness in an organization. INTRODUCTION Information is one of the resources that an organization is heavily dependent on. If the critical information of an organization is compromised, the organization can suffer serious consequences, that is, in the form of loss of income, loss of customers' trust and maybe legal action etc. Therefore, information should be protected and secured. Information security awareness is about guaranteeing that all employees are aware of the rules and regulations regarding securing the information within organization. Information security awareness should therefore form an integral part of any organizations' overall information security management plan. Many organizations use readymade information securtiy awareness tools developed by some of the international information security companies, whereas Abbreviations: KAB, knowledge-attitude-behaviour; TPB, theory of planned behavior; TRA, theory of reasoned action; CBT, computer-based training. some organizations make their own awareness tools according to the needs of the organization. By implementing information security awareness program, it is not guaranteed that every audience have understood and obeyed the guidelines, therefore, it is necessary to measure how much a particular method is effective in fulfilling its purpose. Related work Kruger and Kearney (2006) developed a prototype model for measuring information security awareness in an international gold mining company. They measured the effectiveness of information security awareness program on the basis of knowledge, attitude and behavior. However, their research lacks the study of the underlying theory of the model. Hagen et al. (2008) conducted research by analyzing answers of research question from 87 information se-curity managers in Norwegian organizations. Albrechtsen and Hovden (2010) described 'information security dialogue' as an effective tool for increasing awareness, however, the study lacks the fact that how effective is},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t The paper discusses and evaluates the effects of an information security awareness pro-gramme. The programme emphasised employee participation, dialogue and collective reflection in groups. The intervention consisted of small-sized workshops aimed at improving information security awareness and behaviour. An experimental research design consisting of one survey before and two after the intervention was used to evaluate whether the intended changes occurred. Statistical analyses revealed that the intervention was powerful enough to significantly change a broad range of awareness and behaviour indicators among the intervention participants. In the control group, awareness and behaviour remained by and large unchanged during the period of the study. Unlike the approach taken by the intervention studied in this paper, mainstream information security awareness measures are typically top-down, and seek to bring about changes at the individual level by means of an expert-based approach directed at a large population, e.g. through formal presentations, e-mail messages, leaflets and posters. This study demon-strates that local employee participation, collective reflection and group processes produce changes in short-term information security awareness and behaviour.},

abstract = {The corporate information systems users often engage in risky behavior that can threaten the security and integrity of an organization by exposing sensitive information or weakening the existing technological perimeter security. This risky user behavior can be intentional or unintentional, but in either case can cause severe damage to an organization's reputation as well as potentially extending harm to the organization's clients and customers. Information systems users not following the corporate security policies, even though they know the policies, is known as user omissive behavior, also known as the knowing–doing gap. This research examines the information assurance understanding and security awareness at the user level by developing a structured model of the user knowing–doing gap. The model examines the role of organizational narcissism and its affect on user attitudes towards following the organization's information security policies and procedures. It also includes perceived threat as a factor affecting user attitudes towards following information security rules, as well as subjective norms and perceived behavior control consistent with the theory of planned behavior. This structured model provides a framework and description of user information security behavior and the knowing–doing gap.},

abstract = {The Internet and information technology have influenced human life significantly. However, information security is still an important concern for both users and organizations. Technology cannot solely guarantee a secure environment for information; the human aspects of information security should be taken into consideration, besides the technological aspects. The lack of information security awareness, ignorance, negligence, apathy, mischief, and resistance are the root of users' mistakes. In this research, a novel model shows how complying with organizational information security policies shapes and mitigates the risk of employees' behaviour. The significant aspect of this research is derived from the conceptualization of different aspects of involvement, such as information security knowledge sharing, collaboration, intervention and experience, as well as attachment, commitment, and personal norms that are important elements in the Social Bond Theory. The results of the data analysis revealed that information security knowledge sharing, collaboration, intervention and experience all have a significant effect on employees' attitude towards compliance with organizational information security policies. However, attachment does not have a significant effect on employees' attitude towards information security policy compliance. In addition, the findings have shown that commitment and personal norms affect employees' attitude. Attitude towards compliance with information security organizational policies also has a significant effect on the behavioural intention regarding information security compliance.},

abstract = {The mobile phone has become a necessity for many students; however it also exposes them to security threats that may result in a loss of information. In developing countries, large numbers of students are at a disadvantage because they have limited access to information relating to information security threats, unlike their counterparts in more developed societies who can readily access this information from sources such as the Internet. In addition, the developmental environment is plagued with challenges like access to the Internet and limited access to computers. The poor security behaviour exhibited by student users of mobile phones, which was confirmed by the findings of this study, is of particular interest in the context of the university in this study as most undergraduate students are offered a computer-related course which covers certain information security-related principles. This study addressed the problem of low information security awareness levels among student mobile phone users with the objective of levering security awareness as a way of stimulating safer security behaviours among mobile phone users. The resulting changes in awareness were then juxtaposed against behavioural intent changes in the proposed Information Security Behaviour Profiling Framework. Action research was selected as the appropriate methodology for this study, which saw mobile phone users exposed to various awareness campaigns with their behaviour observed before and after these interventions. This paper proposes a framework which can be used to forecast the information security behaviour profiles of student mobile phone users. The findings of this study uncover a possible link between information security awareness and information security behavioural intention, which translates into the security behaviour profiles exhibited by mobile phone users. By using the proposed framework to examine the association between information security awareness and mobile phone user security behavioural intent, this paper proposes a new method for tracking and categorising student mobile phone user security behavioural profiles. While the level of student information security awareness and behavioural intent were measured, no comparison was made between the awareness interventions implemented as part of this action research study.},

abstract = {Today, the Internet can be considered to be a basic commodity, similar to electricity, without which many businesses simply cannot operate. However, information security for both private and business aspects is important. Experts believe that technology cannot solely guarantee a secure environment for information. Users' behaviour should be considered as an important factor in this domain. The Internet is a huge network with great potential for information security breaches. Hackers use different methods to change confidentiality, integrity, and the availability of information in line with their benefits, while users intentionally or through negligence are a great threat for information security. Sharing their account information, downloading any software from the Internet, writing passwords on sticky paper, and using social security numbers as a username or password are examples of their mistakes. Users' negligence, ignorance, lack of awareness, mischievous, apathy and resistance are usually the reasons for security breaches. Users' poor information security behaviour is the main problem in this domain and the presented model endeavours to reduce the risk of users' behaviour in this realm. The results of structural equation modelling (SEM) showed that Information Security Awareness, Information Security Organization Policy, Information Security Experience and Involvement, Attitude towards information security, Subjective Norms, Threat Appraisal, and Information Security Self-efficacy have a positive effect on users' behaviour. However, Perceived Behavioural Control does not affect their behaviour significantly. The Protection Motivation Theory and Theory of Planned Behaviour were applied as the backbone of the research model.},

abstract = {Aim Data-protection regulations in German hospitals, based on data-protection laws and internal regulations, must be complied with and taken into account in daily work. However, these regulations are not always respected, as evidenced by the data-protection scandals in Germany of recent years. Subjects and methods In a 2010 survey, data was collected from 557 individuals including administrative staff, nursing staff, physicians, physicians with scientific/research-based work and other health professionals of 26 hospitals in Germany to analyze the factors of relevance with regard to data-protection compliance. Results The acceptance of hospital staff concerning data-protection regulations is significantly influenced by subjec-tive values and personal attitudes. Significant differences related to the acceptance of data-protection rules and regulations can be found in gender or type of hospital. The results show that employees consider rules and regulations to be necessary and important. However damage caused by data security breaches and the likelihood that they will occur, are considered to be less significant. A large impact on individual data-protection compliance can be reported in the subjective norm, which is influenced by the effect of close colleagues and superiors. Conclusion The underlying results of the study at hand demonstrate practical implications which can lead to a high degree of data-protection compliance in the future. The related aspects deserving future investigation of the possible explan-ations for differences in behavior related to data protection among various occupational groups in hospitals are discussed. Men and women exhibit very different levels of data-protection acceptance, so future efforts to increase sensitivity and awareness of data-protection issues in employees require gender-specific approaches. Another issue that merits inves-tigation is the source of the influence of hospital type on data-protection compliance.},

abstract = {The human-centred security research area came into being about fifteen years ago, as more and more people started owning their own computers, and it became clear that there was a need for more fo-cus on the non-specialist computer user. The primary attitude fifteen years ago, in terms of how these new users were concerned, was one of exasperation and paternalism. The term " stupid user " was often heard, often muttered sotto voce by an IT specialist dealing with the aftermath of a security incident. A great deal of research has been published in this area, and after pursuing some unfruitful avenues a number of eminent researchers have started to focus on the end-user's perceptions and un-derstandings. This has come from a realisation that end users are not the opponents, but rather allies in the battle against those carrying out nefarious activities. The most promising research direction currently ap-pears to be to focus on mental models, a concept borrowed from the respected and long-standing field of Psychology and, in particular, cog-nitive science. The hope is that if we understand the end-user and his/her comprehension of security better, we will be able to design security so-lutions and interactions more effectively. In this paper we review the research undertaken in this area so far, highlight the limitations thereof, and suggest directions for future research.},

abstract = {Security matters have become an integral part of daily life, and organizations need to ensure that they are adequately secured. A number of best practice frameworks exist to help organizations assess their security risks, implement appropriate security controls, and comply with governance requirements as well as privacy and information security regulations. Organizations today must deal with a multitude of information security risks. Some best practices that facilitate the implementation of security controls include Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT), ISO/IEC 17799/BS 7799, Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), and Operationally Critical Threat, Asset and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE). ISO/IEC 17799 comprises 10 security domains and seeks to address security compliance at all levels: managerial, organizational, legal, operational, and technical. The increasing interest in security frameworks is due to new governance legislation, to a growing awareness of the importance of information security, and to security audit demands by financial institutions and insurance companies.

abstract = {In recent years, rapid progress in the use of the internet has resulted in huge losses in many organizations due to lax security. As a result, information security awareness is becoming an important issue to anyone using the Internet. To reduce losses, organizations have made information security awareness a top priority. The three main barriers to information security awareness are: (1) general security awareness, (2) employees' computer skills, and (3) organizational budgets. Online learning appears a feasible alternative to providing information security awareness and countering these three barriers. Research has identified three levels of security awareness: perception, comprehension and projection. This paper reports on a laboratory experiment that investigates the impacts of hypermedia, multimedia and hypertext to increase information security awareness among the three awareness levels in an online training environment. The results indicate that: (1) learners who have the better understanding at the perception and comprehension levels can improve understanding at the projection level; (2) learners with text material perform better at the perception level; and (3) learners with multimedia material perform better at the comprehension level and projection level. The results could be used by educators and training designers to create meaningful information security awareness materials.},

Abstract Employee noncompliance with information systems security policies is a key concern for organizations. If users do not comply with IS security policies, security solutions lose their efficacy. Of the different IS security policy compliance ap proaches, training is the most commonly suggested in the literature. Yet, few of the existing studies about training to promote IS policy compliance utilize theory to explain what learning principles affect user compliance with IS security policies, or offer empirical evidence of their practical effec Detmar Straub was the accepting senior editor for this paper. Suprateek Sarker served as the associate editor. The appendices for this paper are located in the "Online Supplements" section of the MIS Quarterly's website (http://www.misq.org). tiveness. Consequently, there is a need for IS security training approaches that are theory-based and empirically evaluated. Accordingly, we propose a training program based on two theories: the universal constructive instruc tional theory and the elaboration likelihood model. We then validate the training program for IS security policy com pliance training through an action research project. The action research intervention suggests that the theory-based training achievedpositive results and was practical to deploy. Moreover, the intervention suggests that information security training should utilize contents and methods that activate and motivate the learners to systematic cognitive processing of information they receive during the training. In addition, the action research study made clear that a continuous communi cation process was also required to improve user IS security policy compliance. The findings of this study offer new insights for scholars and practitioners involved in IS security policy compliance.},

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to measure and discuss the effects of an e-learning tool aiming at improving the information security knowledge, awareness, and behaviour of employees. Design/methodology/approach – The intervention study has a pre-and post-assessment of knowledge and attitudes among employees. In total, 1,897 employees responded to a survey before and after the intervention. The population is divided into an intervention group and a control group, where the only thing that separates the groups is participation in the intervention (i.e. the e-learning tool). Findings – The study documents significant short-time improvements in security knowledge, awareness, and behavior of members of the intervention group. Research limitations/implications – The study looks at short-time effects of the intervention. The paper has done a follow-up study of the long-term effects, which is also submitted to Information Management {\&} Computer Security. Practical implications – The study can document that software that support Information Security Awareness programs have a short-time effect on employees' knowledge, behaviour, and awareness; more interventions studies, following the same principles as presented in this paper, of other user-directed measures are needed, to test and document the effects of different measures. Originality/value – The paper is innovative in the area of information security research as it shows how the effects of an information security intervention can be measured.},

abstract = { $\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$tEffective user security awareness campaign can greatly enhance the information assurance posture of an organization. Information security includes organizational aspects, legal aspects, institutionalization and applications of best practices in addition to security technologies. User awareness represents a significant challenge in the security domain, with the human factor ultimately being the element that is exploited in a variety of attack scenarios. Information security awareness program is a critical component in any organizations strategy. In contrast to other information security awareness work which mostly explains methods and techniques for raising information security awareness; this paper discusses and evaluates the effectiveness of different information security awareness tools and techniques on the basis of psychological theories and models. Finally, it describes how to measure information security awareness in an organization.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$t $\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$tKey words: Information security, awareness, effectiveness, psychological, management.},

This glossary includes most of the terms in the NIST publications. It also contains nearly all of the terms and definitions from CNSSI-4009. This glossary provides a central resource of terms and definitions most commonly used in NIST information security publications and in CNSS information assurance publications. For a given term, we do not include all definitions in NIST documents ? especially not from the older NIST publications. Since draft documents are not stable, we do not refer to terms/definitions in them. Each entry in the glossary points to one or more source NIST publications, and/or CNSSI-4009, and/or supplemental sources where appropriate. The NIST publications referenced are the most recent versions of those publications (as of the date of this document).},

abstract = {The concept of roles has been prevalent in the area of Information Security for more than 15 years already. It promises simplified and flexible user management, reduced administrative costs, improved security, as well as the integration of employees' business functions into the IT administration. A comprehensive scientific literature collection revealed more than 1300 publications dealing with the application of sociological role theory in the context of Information Security up to now. Although there is an ANSI/NIST standard and an ISO standard proposal, a variety of competing models and interpretations of the role concept have developed. The major contribution of this survey is a categorization of the complete underlying set of publications into different classes. The main part of the work is investigating 32 identified research directions, evaluating their importance and analyzing research tendencies. An electronic bibliography including all surveyed publications together with the classification information is provided additionally. As a final contribution potential future developments in the area of role-research are considered. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to provide an overview of theories used in the field of employees' information systems (IS) security behavior over the past decade. Research gaps and implications for future research are worked out by analyzing and synthesizing existing literature. Design/methodology/approach – This paper presents the results of a literature review comprising 113 publications. The literature review was designed to identify applied theories and to understand the cognitive determinants in the research field. A meta-model that explains employees' IS security behavior is introduced by assembling the core constructs of the used theories. Findings – The paper identified 54 used theories, but four behavioral theories were primarily used: Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), General Deterrence Theory (GDT), Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). By synthesizing results of empirically tested research models, a survey of factors proven to have a significant influence on employees' security behavior is presented. Research limitations/implications – Some relevant publications might be missing within this literature review due to the selection of search terms and/or databases. However, by conduction a forward and a backward search, this paper has limited this error source to a minimum. Practical implications – This study presents an overview of determinants that have been proven to influence employees' behavioral intention. Based thereon, concrete training and awareness measures can be developed. This is valuable for practitioners in the process of designing Security Education, Training and Awareness (SETA) programs. Originality/value – This paper presents a comprehensive up-to-date overview of existing academic literature in the field of employees' security awareness and behavior research. Based on a developed meta-model, research gaps are identified and implications for future research are worked out. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Abstract The main purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between individuals' Information Security Awareness (ISA) and individual difference variables, namely age, gender, personality and risk-taking propensity. Within this study, {\{}ISA{\}} was defined as individuals' knowledge of what policies and procedures they should follow, their understanding of why they should adhere to them (their attitude) and what they actually do (their behaviour). This was measured using the Human Aspects of Information Security Questionnaire (HAIS-Q). Individual difference variables were examined via a survey of 505 working Australians. It was found that conscientiousness, agreeableness, emotional stability and risk-taking propensity significantly explained variance in individuals' ISA, while age and gender did not. Knowledge of, and attitude towards information security (InfoSec) policies and procedures, explained the most variance in self-reported InfoSec behaviour. Findings highlighted the need for future research to examine individual differences and their impact on ISA. Results of the study can be applied by industry to develop tailored InfoSec training programs. },

The tool provides an environment that permits the user to simulate the introduction of security into a number of pre-defined case study scenarios. This enables staff to become familiar with the types of countermeasures available, the situations in which they are appropriate and any constraints that they may impose.

With the introduction of information technology and the resulting security challenges that organizations face daily, it has become essential to ensure the security of the organization's information and other valuable assets. However, one aspect that auditing does not cover effectively is that of the behaviour of the employee, which is so crucial to any organization's security. The objective of this paper is to explore the potential problems concerning the attempt to audit the behaviour of the employee. It will be demonstrated that it is extremely difficult to audit human behaviour and so an alternative method to behavioural auditing needs to be found, where policing the employee is not necessary, but instead a softer, more informal approach is used to change the culture to a more information security conscious one. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The literature agrees that the major threat to IS security is constituted by careless employees who do not comply with organizations' IS security policies and procedures. To address this concern , different approaches for ensuring employees' IS security policy compliance have been proposed. Prior research on IS security compliance has criticized these extant IS security awareness approaches as lacking theoretically and empirically grounded principles to ensure that employees comply with IS security policies. To fill this gap, this study proposes a theoretical model that contains the factors that explain employees' IS security policy compliance. Data (N=245) from a Finnish company provides empirical support for the model. The results suggest tha t information quality has a significant effect on actual IS security policy compliance. Employees' attitude, normative beliefs and habits have significant effect on intention to comply with IS security policy. Threat appraisa l a nd facilitating conditions have significant impact on attitude towards complying, while coping appraisal does not have a significant effect on employees' attitude towards complying. Sanctions have insignificant effect on intention to comply with IS security policy a nd rewards do not have a significant effect on actual compliance with IS security policy.},

In this work we present a general formal framework to perform analysis for malicious insider threats, based on probabilistic modelling, verification, and synthesis techniques. The framework first identifies insiders' intention to perform an inside attack, using Bayesian networks, and in a second phase computes the probability of success for an inside attack by this actor, using probabilistic model checking.},

abstract = {The aim of this survey is largely exploratory, namely, to discover patterns and trends in the way that practitioners and academics alike tackle the security awareness issue and to have a better understanding of the reasons why security awareness practice remains an unsolved problem. Open coding analysis was performed on numerous publications (articles, surveys, standards, reports and books). A classification scheme of six categories of concern has emerged from the content analysis (e.g., terminology ambiguity), and the chosen publications were classified based on it. The paper identifies ambiguous aspects of current security awareness approaches and the proposed classification provides a guide to identify the range of options available to researchers and practitioners when they design their research and practice on information security awareness.

abstract = {Cloud Computing services are increasingly being made available by the UK Government through the Government digital marketplace to reduce costs and improve IT efficiency; however, little is known about factors influencing the decision making process to adopt cloud services within the UK Government. This research aims to develop a theoretical framework to understand risk perception and risk acceptance of cloud computing services. Study's subjects (N=24) were recruited from three UK Government organizations to attend a semi structured interview. Transcribed texts were analyzed using the approach termed interpretive phenomenological analysis. Results showed that the most important factors influencing risk acceptance of cloud services are: perceived benefits and opportunities, organization's risk culture and perceived risks. We focused on perceived risks and perceived security concerns. Based on these results, we suggest a number of implications for risk managers, policy makers and cloud service providers.},

abstract = {Knowledge-intensive organizations are characterized by their dependency
on highly skilled personnel who perform their daily work in a
decentralized manner. In these organizations it is the users who make
the important decisions, and therefore the organization's information
security awareness is upheld by and depends on its users' combined
security awareness. To assess the overall organizational security
awareness it therefore becomes interesting to assess both the users'
individual level of security awareness, as well as their level of
consistency and conformity with regard to other users' awareness.
In the present case study, 15 semi-structured interviews have been
undertaken within a large telecommunication company in order to
understand how significant IT security aspects are understood within the
organization. The study highlights a number of perception differences
where the technical IT staff and the ordinary users do not share the
same understanding. It is suggested that these perception differences
result from a paradoxical situation where the users' possibility to
uphold security awareness is hindered because of security concerns.},

The fact that human factors play a crucial part in the majority of accidents is a troubling feature of modern security know-how: We can implement appropriate technical solutions, but we still fail to handle the human factor. Our research project aims at understanding better the role of human factors in information security systems. We develop a system dynamical simulation model to explore the complex security problem. We use a simple, fictitious case to illustrate how system dynamics may deliver insights into the people security problem and help in designing robust security policies.

Human factors play a significant role in computer security; factors such as individual difference, cognitive abilities and personality traits can impact on behaviour.

The grounded theory approach was used to analyze responses to open‐ended questions answered by 220 certified information system security professionals. Using these responses, a survey instrument was developed. Survey results were analyzed using structural equation modeling.Findings – Evidence suggests that top management support is a significant predictor of an organization's security culture and level of policy enforcement.Research limitations/implications – During instrument validation, a special effort removed survey items that appeared overly intrusive to the respondents. In this endeavor, an expert panel of security practitioners evaluated all candidate items on a willingness‐to‐answer scal...},

Maintaining protection and privacy of personal information is a strong motivation in the development of security policies. It is critical for health care organizations to access, analyze, and ensure security policies to meet the challenge and to develop the necessary policies to ensure the security of medical information. The problem, then, is how we can maintain the availability of the electronic medical records and at the same time maintain the privacy of patients' information. This paper will propose a novel architecture model for the Electronic Medical Record (EMR), in which useful statistical medical records will be available to the interested parties while maintaining the privacy of patients' information.},

The study identified 22 types of threats according to major threat categories based on ISO/IEC 27002 (ISO 27799:2008). The results show that the most critical threat for the THIS is power failure followed by acts of human error or failure and other technological factors. This research holds significant value in terms of providing a complete taxonomy of threat categories in HIS and also an important component in the risk analysis stage.},

	abstract = {Today, the Internet can be considered to be a basic commodity, similar to electricity, without which many businesses simply cannot operate. However, information security for both private and business aspects is important. Experts believe that technology cannot solely guarantee a secure environment for information. Users' behaviour should be considered as an important factor in this domain. The Internet is a huge network with great potential for information security breaches. Hackers use different methods to change confidentiality, integrity, and the availability of information in line with their benefits, while users intentionally or through negligence are a great threat for information security. Sharing their account information, downloading any software from the Internet, writing passwords on sticky paper, and using social security numbers as a username or password are examples of their mistakes. Users' negligence, ignorance, lack of awareness, mischievous, apathy and resistance are usually the reasons for security breaches. Users' poor information security behaviour is the main problem in this domain and the presented model endeavours to reduce the risk of users' behaviour in this realm. The results of structural equation modelling (SEM) showed that Information Security Awareness, Information Security Organization Policy, Information Security Experience and Involvement, Attitude towards information security, Subjective Norms, Threat Appraisal, and Information Security Self-efficacy have a positive effect on users' behaviour. However, Perceived Behavioural Control does not affect their behaviour significantly. The Protection Motivation Theory and Theory of Planned Behaviour were applied as the backbone of the research model.},

	abstract = {The authors found the behavioral factors that influence the organization members' compliance with the information security policy in organizations on the basis of neutralization theory, Theory of planned behavior, and protection motivation theory. Depending on the theory of planned behavior, members' attitudes towards compliance, as well as normative belief and self-efficacy, were believed to determine the intention to comply with the information security policy. Neutralization theory, a prominent theory in criminology, could be expected to provide the explanation for information system security policy violations. Based on the protection motivation theory, it was inferred that the expected efficacy could have an impact on intentions of compliance. By the above logical reasoning, the integrative behavioral model and eight hypotheses could be derived. Data were collected by conducting a survey; 194 out of 207 questionnaires were available. The test of the causal model was conducted by PLS. The reliability, validity, and model fit were found to be statistically significant. The results of the hypotheses tests showed that seven of the eight hypotheses were acceptable. The theoretical implications of this study are as follows: (1) the study is expected to play a role of the baseline for future research about organization members' compliance with the information security policy, (2) the study attempted an interdisciplinary approach by combining psychology and information system security research, and (3) the study suggested concrete operational definitions of influencing factors for information security policy compliance through a comprehensive theoretical review. Also, the study has some practical implications. First, it can provide the guideline to support the successful execution of the strategic establishment for the implement of information system security policies in organizations. Second, it proves that the need of education and training programs suppressing members' neutralization intention to violate information security policy should be emphasized.},

This paper is giving list of cloud computing advantages and disadvantages and some reasons will cause company adopt cloud based services or avoiding. The small and medium size enterprise does not possess sufficient financial and human recourse, in comparison to the large size factories, hence they are not capable of upgrading their IT requirements efficiently, It will not allow them to have a sufficient chance to compete with powerful competitors, in a business environment. Evaluating the impact of organizational factors on cloud computing adoption in SMEs was determined as the main purpose of this study and led to focus on the TOE framework as a famous theory on evaluating IT adoption. For this purpose, organizational context divided into three main factors in base of TOE framework include organizational, environmental and technical context. Three set of critical success factor criteria chosen by review of previous studies for each three level of organizational factors. It can be helpful for small and medium size enterprises which want to evaluate their organizational condition for adopting cloud based services. Keywords},

	abstract = {The responsibility that physicians have to protect their patients from harm extends to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of patient health information including that contained within radiological images. The intent of HIPAA and subsequent HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules is to keep patients' private information confidential while allowing providers access to and maintaining the integrity of relevant information needed to provide care. Failure to comply with electronic protected health information (ePHI) regulations could result in financial or criminal penalties or both. Protected health information refers to anything that can reasonably be used to identify a patient (eg, name, age, date of birth, social security number, radiology examination accession number). The basic tools and techniques used to maintain medical information security and patient privacy described in this article include physical safeguards such as computer device isolation and data backup, technical safeguards such as firewalls and secure transmission modes, and administrative safeguards including documentation of security policies, training of staff, and audit tracking through system logs. Other important concepts related to privacy and security are explained, including user authentication, authorization, availability, confidentiality, data integrity, and nonrepudiation. Patient privacy and security of medical information are critical elements in today's electronic health care environment. Radiology has led the way in adopting digital systems to make possible the availability of medical information anywhere anytime, and in identifying and working to eliminate any risks to patients.},

	abstract = {Today, the Internet can be considered to be a basic commodity, similar to electricity, without which many businesses simply cannot operate. However, information security for both private and business aspects is important. Experts believe that technology cannot solely guarantee a secure environment for information. Users' behaviour should be considered as an important factor in this domain. The Internet is a huge network with great potential for information security breaches. Hackers use different methods to change confidentiality, integrity, and the availability of information in line with their benefits, while users intentionally or through negligence are a great threat for information security. Sharing their account information, downloading any software from the Internet, writing passwords on sticky paper, and using social security numbers as a username or password are examples of their mistakes. Users' negligence, ignorance, lack of awareness, mischievous, apathy and resistance are usually the reasons for security breaches. Users' poor information security behaviour is the main problem in this domain and the presented model endeavours to reduce the risk of users' behaviour in this realm. The results of structural equation modelling (SEM) showed that Information Security Awareness, Information Security Organization Policy, Information Security Experience and Involvement, Attitude towards information security, Subjective Norms, Threat Appraisal, and Information Security Self-efficacy have a positive effect on users' behaviour. However, Perceived Behavioural Control does not affect their behaviour significantly. The Protection Motivation Theory and Theory of Planned Behaviour were applied as the backbone of the research model.},

	abstract = {This study explores retrospective (self-reported) and prospective (willingness to engage) participation in digital piracy via a multitheoretical approach relying on self-control, social learning, microanomie, and techniques of neutralization. Using more complete measures of digital piracy than in previous studies (illegal music, software, and movie downloading), data were collected from undergraduate students from multiple universities (n = 585). Modest support was found for neutralization theory when controlling for other theoretical variables. Modest support was also established for social learning theory. It is clear that there is an underexplored cross-theoretical dynamic in explaining self-reported piracy and willingness to engage in digital piracy. Suggestions for policy and future research are presented and limitations are accounted for.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, concerns related to healthcare data privacy have been mounting since healthcare information has become more digitized, distributed and mobile. However, very little is known about the root cause of data breach incidents; making it difficult for healthcare organizations to establish proper security controls and defenses. Through a systematic review and synthesis of data breaches literature, and using databases of earlier reported healthcare data breaches, the authors re-examine and analyze the causal fac-tors behind healthcare data breaches. The authors then use the Swiss Cheese Model (SCM) to shed light on the technical, organizational and human factors of these breaches. The author's research suggests that incorporating the SCM concepts into the healthcare security policies and procedures can assist healthcare providers in assessing the vulnerabilities and risks associated with the maintenance and transmission of protected health information.},

@article{Barlow2013,
	abstract = {a b s t r a c t Past research on information technology (IT) security training and awareness has focused on informing employees about security policies and formal sanctions for violating those policies. However, research suggests that deterrent sanctions may not be the most powerful influencer of employee violations. Often, employees use rationalizations, termed neutralization techniques, to overcome the effects of deterrence when deciding whether or not to violate a policy. Therefore, neutralization techniques often are stronger than sanctions in predicting employee behavior. For this study, we examine " denial of injury, " " metaphor of the ledger, " and " defense of necessity " as relevant justifications for violating password policies that are commonly used in organizations as used in (Siponen and Vance, 2010). Initial research on neutralization in IS security has shown that results are consistent regardless of which type of neutralization is considered (Siponen and Vance, 2010). In this study, we investigate whether IT security communication focused on mitigating neutral-ization, rather than deterrent sanctions, can reduce intentions to violate security policies. Additionally, considering the effects of message framing in persuading individuals against security policy violations are largely unexamined, we predict that negatively-framed communication will be more persuasive than positively-framed communication. We test our hypotheses using the factorial survey method. Our results suggest that security communication and training that focuses on neutralization techniques is just as effective as communication that focuses on deterrent sanctions in persuading employees not to violate policies, and that both types of framing are equally effective.},

	abstract = {The current study sought to test the viability of employing Sykes and Matza's (1957) techniques of neutralization as a framework for understanding online music piracy. Using data from a sample of 2,032 undergraduates from a large Midwestern university, the relevance of neutralization theory is tested via multinomial logistic regression while controlling for other theoretical predictors and demographic variables. The findings indicated that greater acceptance of the techniques associated with denial of responsibility, denial of injury, denial of victim, and appeal to higher loyalties significantly predicted moderate levels of piracy participation. Furthermore, the effect of appeals to higher loyalty on piracy was found to be conditioned by the respondent's approval of the behavior. Overall, results suggested that university settings may unwittingly facilitate a climate for online piracy whereby students place a higher value on group norms rather than legal norms and do not consider the harms associated with the behavior.
